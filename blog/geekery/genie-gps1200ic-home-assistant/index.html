      <p>My garage has two doors. I&rsquo;d like to be able to say &ldquo;Open the garage door&rdquo; to Siri.</p>
<p>To get there, I&rsquo;m going to try using Home Assistant and ESPHome.

<h2 id="hack-a-remote">Hack a remote?</h2>
<p>My first attempt was to buy a remote and hook a microcontroller to it.
I bought a Genie GITR-3 remote. This remote has 3 buttons.
The plan was to wire an ESP8266 to the buttons of this remote.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this remote doesn&rsquo;t work correctly on my garage doors.
In the manual, this remote says &ldquo;For models made prior to 1996, only the right-most button works&rdquo;</p>
<p>Welp.
Turns out, only the right-most button works on my garage doors.
I have two doors, and spending another $30 for <em>another</em> remote for this project doesn&rsquo;t feel that great.</p>
<h2 id="hack-the-wall-buttons">Hack the wall buttons?</h2>
<p>On the wall of my garage are your typical garage door open buttons. These panels are typically wired directly to the garage motor controller on the garage ceiling.</p>
<p>My panel has two buttons.
Pulling the panel apart shows a very simple circuit.
Two buttons, two resistors, one LED, and a switch.</p>
<img src="wall-control-panel-circuit.jpg" alt="Genie Series II wall control panel circuitboard">
<p>Making some guesses and measurements, this seems to use some kind of voltage
division circuit. I&rsquo;m not well-trained on electronics, but I&rsquo;m assuming the
second resistor in the voltage divider is inside the garage opener motor
itself. Anyway, the voltage changes depending on the state of the buttons.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;door&rdquo; button uses an 82.5ohm resistor. I didn&rsquo;t have any of those, so I
tried a few different ones. Shorting the garage opener contacts with a 47ohm
resistor does indeed open the door. Using a 480ohm resistor will toggle the light on the garage door opener.</p>
