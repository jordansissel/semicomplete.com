<p>This is encouragement to migrate. Bitwarden and 1Password seem like reasonable alternatives, at least for now, until fate comes for them as well.</p>
<p>Because the LastPass breach creates a threat that customer password vaults were copied, it means that any migration isn&rsquo;t complete without changing passwords.</p>
<p>All of them. A boulder suddenly appears.</p>
<p>I have more than 200 entries in my password vault and rotating every single one is going to be a huge, boring chore. The tools don&rsquo;t help, either, as far as I can tell. Bitwarden, for example, doesn&rsquo;t have an easy way for a normal human to do this password change task. Every website has their own unique and often terrible password change process, and Bitwarden is happy to add even more steps.</p>
<p>Most password change workflows, in my experience, ask you for your current password and your desired new password at the same time.</p>
<p>In Bitwarden, changing a password is fairly easy, but it&rsquo;s not obvious how to find the old one. I can edit a vault entry and click the &ldquo;🔄 Generate Password&rdquo; button, but as soon as that process is done, the old password is put into the password history which is kind of hidden behind small text that doesn&rsquo;t even look like something I can click on, and to even see this small inconspicuous text, you have to scroll down in what looks like a small popup window with minimal indication that it can even be scrolled. I&rsquo;d love to see a kind of password change workflow in password managers where both the old and new password are available at the same time without hassle.</p>
<p><img src="password-history.png" alt="A Bitwarden vault entry with a circle around the number &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; with an arrow pointing at it. The number looks like text with no indications it can be interacted with" title="Bitwarden UI showing password history"></p>
<p>What does this password change process look like with Bitwarden?</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a vault entry and visit the site</li>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Find the password change feature on the site (good luck!)</li>
<li>Open the vault again</li>
<li>Edit the entry for the current site</li>
<li>Click 🔄 to generate a new password</li>
<li>Save</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the vault entry to find, in small font, &ldquo;Password history&rdquo; and click the number (probably <code>1</code>).</li>
<li>Copy the old password</li>
<li>Paste into &ldquo;old password&rdquo; field on the site</li>
<li>Go back into the vault, copy the new password</li>
<li>Paste it again, probably twice, into the site</li>
<li>Finish!</li>
</ol>
<p>This is too many steps, and it&rsquo;s needed each time for every entry in the vault. I want to scream.</p>
<p>Doing this on mobile is even worse because switching back and forth between apps makes this process way slower. It&rsquo;s extremely reasonable to expect that very few people will even attempt to change all of their passwords.</p>
<p>This whole process is made even more difficult because I can&rsquo;t find any way to ask the Bitwarden mobile or desktop apps for help doing this &ndash; even just giving me a list of passwords I haven&rsquo;t changed recently would help, but there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;sort&rdquo; in the vault. I&rsquo;d love to sort by something contextual and intelligent like risk or impact &ndash; like show me financial logins and major communication tools first, etc. I have to settle for sorting things by the last time they were changed, which, again, the Bitwarden mobile and desktop apps do not help with.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/">command-line tool for Bitwarden</a> that prints JSON, and I can use that. The following shell command will sort vault entries by &ldquo;revisionDate&rdquo;, oldest first.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>bw list items | jq -r &#39;. | sort_by(.revisionDate) | .[] | &#34;\(.name) - \(.revisionDate)&#34;&#39;
</code></pre><p>This will output the site name and the revision date.</p>
<p>If I can find the energy, maybe I can do 5 to 10 of these per day? I don&rsquo;t know. Pipe this output to <code>| head -n 5</code> to give 5 sites that need changing.</p>
<p>I am certain, however, with the current trend of public information security posture among large corporations, that if I don&rsquo;t go through this boring, solitary, and extremely tedious task, then whatever negative happens afterwards must be surely my fault.</p>
<p>This boulder isn&rsquo;t going to push itself.</p>
