      <h1 id="alternative-to-npm-install--g">Alternative to <code>npm install -g</code></h1>
<p>I was reading through the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/your-first-app">Ionic+Vue tutorial</a> with eager eyes set on a goal of making a silly webapp. I still have that goal, but I took a small side quest.</p>
<p>The docs explain that you&rsquo;ll need to install the Ionic command-line tool, and offers this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>npm install -g @ionic/cli@latest native-run cordova-res</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately after this line, it has a warning that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The -g option means install globally. When packages are installed globally, EACCES permission errors can occur.</p>
<p>Consider setting up npm to operate globally without elevated permissions. See <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/tips#resolving-permission-errors">Resolving Permission Errors</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re barely done reading one page of text in the docs and already it&rsquo;s telling us that a command will fail and to begin a side quest to go solve that command, that they told us to use that they also say will fail.</p>
<h1 id="bad-habits">Bad Habits</h1>
<p>We (software developers) have a history of writing tooling that is bad specifically in that it often does not meet the expectations of the users and it also can mislead them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m following a tutorial. I&rsquo;m copy-pasting the commands. I shouldn&rsquo;t be failing!</p>
<p>And yet, here we are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here, having a bad time, because I&rsquo;m now on a side quest 10 seconds into this new game.</p>
<p>If a new user has a bad time, it&rsquo;s a bug.</p>
<p>The fact that we have to call this out in our documentation? It&rsquo;s bad! &ldquo;This is the recommended install technique, and we know it doesn&rsquo;t work most of the time&rdquo;</p>
<p>I applaud this <em>being</em> documented, but I do not applaud this being necessary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used a little bit of Node.js for a decade, and this error feels so common! The documentation says &ldquo;Install with <code>npm install -g ...</code>&rdquo; which then fails.</p>
<p>Workarounds are offered, for example, to use a node version manager [screaming intensifies] or <code>chown</code> some directories to be owned by you instead of root. They don&rsquo;t feel like good workarounds. Ruby has this problem too (bundler, rvm), as does Python (virtualenv, venv, etc). It&rsquo;s hardly unique to any particular system.</p>
<h1 id="a-workaround-i-suppose">A workaround, I suppose</h1>
<p>Since <code>npm install</code> defaults (I think? always?) to installing to <code>node_modules</code> in the current directory, we can install ionic like this, almost exactly the way the docs suggest, except we omit <code>-g</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% npm install @ionic/cli@latest native-run cordova-res
</code></pre><p>Now, the <code>ionic</code> command line tool will be in a path like <code>node_modules/&lt;name&gt;/bin/ionic</code> and in this case, it&rsquo;s <code>node_modules/@ionic/cli/bin/ionic</code>. We can run it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% ./node_modules/@ionic/cli/bin/ionic version
6.20.4
</code></pre><p>It might not <em>feel</em> good to write this full path in the documentation, but I do feel it&rsquo;s better (and with zero side quests!) than the offered <code>npm install -g</code>-plus-caveats approach.</p>
<p>If we want to type less, we can add an npm script to our package.json:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
  &#34;scripts&#34;: {
    &#34;ionic&#34;: &#34;node_modules/@ionic/cli/bin/ionic&#34;
  }
}
</code></pre><p>And now, we can run ionic via npm:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% npm run ionic version

&gt; ionic
&gt; node_modules/@ionic/cli/bin/ionic version

6.20.4
</code></pre><p>Feels better? I think? Zero side quests. No warning of failures to document? Could be cool.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-we-do-this">Why do we do this</h1>
<p>I feel like we (developers, sysadmins, etc) get comfortable with tools such that we no longer notice the things which, to a newbie, are obvious miseries and confusions.</p>
<p>I certainly am guilty of this habit of ignoring sharp edges that we&rsquo;ve simply become accustomed to dodging.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I keep telling folks: <strong>If a new user has a bad time, it&rsquo;s a bug.</strong></p>
<p>If you assume this mindset and broadcast an invitation &ndash; that the stumbling of a new user is a sign of something that needs improvement &ndash; you open yourself to a world of opportunities to improve onboarding for new folks as well as reducing day-to-day frustrations that a system causes to even those who are fluent in a given system.</p>
