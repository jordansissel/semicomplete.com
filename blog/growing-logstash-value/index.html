      <p>I spent a while today thinking about nerdy stuff - logstash, etc. I want to
grow logstash in terms of performance, use case, deployment instances, happy
users, and community.</p>
<p>While musing about on my mental roadmap of logstash, I found most things boil
down to costs and returns on investment, even with open source software.
Money, time, energy, and patience are all costs. Just because something
doesn&rsquo;t cost any money doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t consume any time or energy.</p>
<p>I see two distinct groups of users, with respect to cost. New users and current
users. In terms of inputs and outputs, the phrase &lsquo;return on investment&rsquo; comes
to mind. New users are likely in the evaluation and investigation phase, mainly
estimating ROI or judging &ldquo;is this solution useful to me?&rdquo; Existing users are
likely in the maintenance and integration phases, mainly trying to improve or
maintain ROI or pushing towards improving value provided by a tool.</p>
<p>These two user groups are, in my observation and from a seller&rsquo;s perspective,
quite distinct in terms of strategy. How you acquire happy new users is not
necessarily how you maintain and energize existing users.</p>
<h1 id="targeting-new-users">Targeting New Users</h1>
<p>New users easily stumble on bad documentation, complex architectures, and excessive steps.</p>
<p>I have a few goals regarding minimization for new users: reducing mean time to
demo and mean time to deploy are critical. Reducing &rsquo;time to demo&rsquo; requires
that I focus on minimizing steps required to answer &lsquo;is logstash useful?&rsquo;.
Additionally, ensuring each required step in &rsquo;time to demo&rsquo; is as simple as
possible. Reducing time to deploy means publishing high quality init scripts
(upstart, systemd, sysv init) as well as high quality puppet, chef, and
cfengine modules.</p>
<p>The time someone spends as what I consider a &rsquo;new user&rsquo; is actually quite
short. My goal with users in this stage are to help them quickly and accurately
answer, &ldquo;will this tool benefit me?&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="targeting-existing-users">Targeting Existing Users</h1>
<p>As an existing user of a tool, I&rsquo;m often looking for how to reduce operational,
maintenance, and integration costs. Operational costs appear as physical
resource usage (servers, or fuel-like resources). Maintenance costs appear as
bugs and related investigations, monitoring, etc. Integration costs appear as
time and energy spent making the tool work well with your infrastructure.</p>
<p>These kind of users are usually a bit more invested in use of the tool, but I
want to avoid abusing that fact. Time and energy investments in a free tool
can cause as much vendor trappings as monetary investments. Don&rsquo;t treat
your existing users like dirt, right?</p>
<p>My goal for the next few months is to become one of these existing users of
logstash (to date, as I&rsquo;ve confessed, I&rsquo;ve never run logstash in production).
I&rsquo;ll be able to do that at DreamHost (starting tomorrow!).</p>
<p>Additionally, I will be focusing strongly on improving logstash new user
experience. Happier new users should reflect nicely on community growth and
activity. That&rsquo;s my goal, anyway!</p>
