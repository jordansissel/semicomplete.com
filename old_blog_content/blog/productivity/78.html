So <code>xapply -f</code> doesn't cut it for when I want interactive ssh sessions, so I updated my sshall script to use the <code>apply</code> syntax instead of <code>xargs</code>  - this lets me do<p>
<pre>sshall</pre>
<br>
and actually get a login prompt. If I used xapply (as previously) it would complain about not being able to grab stdin (or a tty) because we were doing:<p>
<pre>cat hostlist | xapply -f 'ssh ...'</pre>
<br>
This would give the error message (for each host):
<pre>
project1 -
Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
</pre>

The solution to this problem is varied. You'll probably need the <i>-t</i> option for ssh: ssh -t user@server will allocate a terminal for you on the remote server so console-based applications will work.
