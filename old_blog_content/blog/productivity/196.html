We at CSH need to move from nis and the many other user information datastores we use to using LDAP instead. To that effort, I have started working on merging our data informations. The first step is importing NIS (passwd/group) information into ldap.

<p/>

I wrote a script, <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/projects/scripts/passwd2ldif">passwd2ldif</a>, to use NIS passwd information and put it in ldap.

<pre>
ypcat passwd | ./passwd2ldif > cshusers.ldif
ldapadd -D "cn=happyrootuserthinghere,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu" -f cshusers.ldif
</pre>

Wait a while, and all users from NIS show up in ldap. I have my laptop looking at ldap for user informatin using nss_ldap:

<pre>
nightfall(~) [690] % finger -m psionic
Login: psionic                          Name: Jordan Sissel
Directory: /u9/psionic                  Shell: /usr/bin/tcsh

No Mail.
No Plan.

Pretty simple stuff, so far. Next step is going to involve creating a new
schema to support all of the information we currently store in "member
profiles." Member profiles is a huge mess of a single mysql table with lots of
columns such as "rit_phone," "csh_year," "aol_im," and others. All of that can go to ldap.
I'll post more on this later when I figure out what kind of schema we want.
