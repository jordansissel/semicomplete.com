I use firefox as my primary web browser. I have for a number of years. Lots of things about it irritate me. Today's irritation is it's startup sequence.

<p>

You kids can play at home too! Do this:

<pre>tcpdump -np 'port 53'</pre>

Now, start firefox fresh. Watch it do a dns lookup. Now do something to disable
dns, such as pointing dns at an invalid server, or adding a search suffix to
your dns client such that your hostname.suffix does not exist. Start firefox
again. Watch it do a dns lookup on yourhostname.suffix and FAIL MISERABLY. What
do we do in case of dns failure? Let's wait on DNS!!! WOOT. Except, dns never
comes back. So, let's never start.

<p>

God damnit this is annoying.
