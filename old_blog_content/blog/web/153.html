For the past several years I've more or less ignored the existance of HTML 4,
CSS, and JavaScript. My web design has centered around a fluent knowledge of
html tables and little else. My new website design is much more in tune with
today's web technology. Hopefully, assuming I can get off my butt and do it,
I'll be writing a few articles in the coming weeks about things I've learned
and whatnot.<p>

I started a new project today to try and do a kiosk interface completely via a
web browser. I'll post a link to it when I've actually finished up work on it.
It uses XML, JavaScript, DOM, and fun with CSS. I've already found a "feature"
of Opera that's making me want to switch to back to using firefox for the
devices this interface will run on, but I haven't decided yet.<p>

I may just end up writing something that uses the mozilla rendering engine and
nothing else, but that's probably more work put into this than I want to spend.
More on things as they develop...
