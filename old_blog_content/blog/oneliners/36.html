I have a lot of mail boxes that need sorting from the various lists I subscribe too, and sorting by hand or on "viewing" is annoying, so I got bored and made use of xapply and the 6 processors on fury.csh to sort all of my mailboes.<p>

<code>find ./ -type d | xapply -f -P6 'echo "Sorting %1" && mhthread -fast -lock %1 && echo "Done sorting %1"' -</code><p>

The cwd was ~/mail/ and directories under here are all mailboxes. So, xapply uses 6 parallel processes to call mhthread on each mailbox that was found.
