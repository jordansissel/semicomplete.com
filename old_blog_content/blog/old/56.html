This just shows the working-ness of both the vim macro to sign an email and the also-workingness of my "mailfilter" script which verifies the email through pgp.<br>

image 1: Normal everyday email<br>
image 2: i hit \t and now gpg want's my passphrase.<br>
image 3: result of gpg and vim keymap (see <code>man mhbuild</code>).<br>
image 4: save it and run <code>mime</code> in whatnow before sending.<br>
image 5: mailfilter script properly verifies the email with gpg.<br>
