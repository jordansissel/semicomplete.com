Finally got off my lazy ass and fixed the broken ultra1s in the usercenter.
<p>
The rundown of problems:<br>
 - eagle and mokey don't have entries in ipedit, which is breaking their intarwebs<br>
 - every so often I try to login to red and it's dead - turned off. Either some jackass is turning it off randomly or it's got a bad power supply. I'll know more later.<br>
 - junior know has a kerberos keytab so people can actually authenticate and login.<br>
