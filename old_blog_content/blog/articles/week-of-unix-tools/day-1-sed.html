      I think it's fair to say that not enough people know sed. Mostly, because
      it's probably scary. This week-of-unix-tools is intended to be a high
      concentration of information with little fluff. I'll be covering only GNU
      versions of the tools, for the sake of choosing only one version for
      sanity sake.

    <h4><a name="id54059">What is sed?</a></h4>
      Sed is short for 'stream editor' and basically lets you do lots of things
      to streams of text.
    <h4><a name="id54065">Basic usage and Invocation</a></h4>
<pre>sed [-lrn] [-e 'sedscript'] [file1 file2 ...]</pre>
<code>-l</code> means line buffered (ie; flush output every line),
      <code>-r</code> means use extended regex, <code>-n</code> silences
      default output, and <code>-e</code> should be self explanatory.  There
      are other flags (such as -f) but I never use them. Seek the man page for
      more information.

      <p></p>

      If you've ever seen the perlism <code>s/foo/bar/</code>, that came from
      sed.  Sed is basically a string processing language. The language
      consists of a very small grammar, but is still very powerful. Here are
      some examples:

      <p></p>
<dl>
<dt> Simple text replacement. </dt>
<dd><pre>
% echo "Hello there foo" |  sed -e 's/foo/bar/'
Hello there bar
</pre></dd>
<dt> Grep-like behavior. </dt>
<dd><pre>
% sed -ne '/FreeBSD/p' /etc/motd
FreeBSD 6.2-PRERELEASE (FOO) #0: Sat Nov 11 00:12:52 EST 2006
Welcome to FreeBSD!
</pre></dd>
<dt> Grep '-v' like behavior </dt>
<dd><pre>
% echo "foo\nbar\nbaz\nfoobar" | sed -ne '/foo/!p'r
bar
baz
</pre></dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id54136">Backreferences</a></h4>

      Backreferences are using a captured group's matched value later in your
      pattern. You group regexp patterns with parenthesis, but in non-extended
      mode (ie; without -r), you must escape your parentheses. Example:

<pre>
% echo "hello world" | sed -e 's/\([a-z]*\) world/\1 sed/'
hello sed

# Now with -r (or -E on FreeBSD and OS X):
% echo "hello world" | sed -r -e 's/([a-z]*) world/\1 sed/'
hello sed
</pre>

      There is a special "reference" when using substitution (s///). Ampersand
      (&amp;).  This will expand to the entire matched pattern:

<pre>
% echo "hello world" | sed -e 's/.*/I say, "&amp;"/'
I say, "hello world"
</pre>
<h4><a name="id54154">Syntax and Functions</a></h4>

      Sed syntax is pretty straight forward. A general expression will look
      like this:

      <p></p>
<code>
      address[,address]function
      </code><p></p>

      That's it. Expressions are separated by newlines or semicolons.

    <h4><a name="id54169">What is a address?</a></h4>

      A address is a way to indicate a location in your data stream. An address can be any of:
      <ol>
<li> A line number (eg 1). The first line is '1' </li>
<li> A regexp match expression, such as /foo/. </li>
<li> The literal '$', which means 'last line of file' </li>
<li> Nothing at all, which means "every line in the file" </li>
</ol>

      If you specify two addresses, it means "inclusive" of the first and last
      address, and includes all lines in between. After the last address is
      hit, the first address is searched for again further down the file. More
      on this later.

    <h4><a name="id54196">What are functions?</a></h4>

      Functions are always one-letter in sed. The useful ones (to me) are:

      <ul>
<li> p (print) </li>
<li> s (substitute) </li>
<li> d (delete) </li>
<li> x (swap pattern and hold buffer) </li>
<li> h and H (copy and append to hold buffer) </li>
<li> ! (apply the next function against lines not matched) </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="id54227">What can I do with sed?</a></h4>
<dl>
<dt> Print the first line of input (same as head -n 1) </dt>
<dd><pre> sed -ne 1p </pre></dd>
<dt> Print everything *except* the first line </dt>
<dd><pre>
sed -ne '1!p' # print everything not on the first line
or
sed -e '1d'   # delete the first line
              # default action is to print, so everything else is printed
</pre></dd>
<dt> Print the first non-whitespace, non-comment line in httpd.conf </dt>
<dd><pre>
sed -ne '/^[^# ]/{p;q;}' httpd.conf
or
sed -ne '/^#/! { /^ *$/! { p;q; }; }' httpd.conf
</pre></dd>
<dt> Show only 'Received:' headers in a mail </dt>
<dd>
<pre>
% cat mymail \
  | sed -ne '/^[A-Za-z0-9]/ { x; /^Received: /{p;}; }; /^[A-Za-z0-9]/!H'

          Noisey code, eh? Gets the job done though. There are two checks here.
          The first pattern checks to see if the line starts with a letter or
          number, if so, it swaps to the "hold" buffer and checks if it starts
          with 'Received:' and prints if it does. The side effect is that the
          current input line is now in the hold buffer and the old header
          "line" is in the pattern space, which we discard. After that, we
          check if the line does *not* start with a letter or number, in which
          case we append the input (aka pattern space) to the hold space.

          <p></p>

          Basically, we build the current header (which can be multiple lines)
          in the hold buffer until the next header happens.

<h4><a name="id54317">Use sed to make a 'section grep' tool</a></h4>

      You can use sed to "grep" paragraphs of data using similar techniques to
      the above mail header example. This script will let you 'grep' whole
      paragraphs (empty-line-delimited).

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -eq 0 -o "${1:-}" = "-h" ] ; then
  echo "usage: $0 [-v] pattern [files]"
  return 1
fi

func='!d'
if [ "$1" = "-v" ]; then
  # support '-v' like 'grep -v' 
  func='d'
  shift
fi

pattern="$1"
shift

sed -ure '/./{H;$!d;}; '"x;/${pattern}/$func;" $1
</pre>

      Call this 'sgrep.sh', put it somewhere, and make it executable. Let's use
      it to find anything with 'Delete' and 'cycle' in FreeBSD's sed manpage :

<pre>
% man sed | ./sgrep.sh 'Delete .* cycle' 

     [2addr]d
             <b>Delete</b> the pattern space and start the next <b>cycle</b>.

     [2addr]D
             <b>Delete</b> the initial segment of the pattern space through the first
             newline character and start the next <b>cycle</b>.
</pre>
<h4><a name="id54351">Bonus notes</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
        The 's' function has a 'p' flag, which prints only if a substitution was made.

        <pre>
# this:
sed -ne '/foo/ { s/foo/bar/; p }'

# is the same as
sed -ne 's/foo/bar/p'
</pre>
</li>
<li>
          You can insert data into the hold space (or the pattern space) if you really want:
          <pre>
# Print 'Hello there' before the second line
% echo "one\ntwo\nthree" | sed -e '2 { x; s/.*/Hello there/; p; x; }'
one
Hello there
two
three
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="id54377">Ok, now what?</a></h4>

      Given your choice of filter tools, sed is an extremely useful one that
      often allows you to describe what you want to do with your text in a
      shorter, simpler form than awk or perl can offer you. If you wish to
      venture down the path of unix ninja, then sed should be on your list of
      commands to understand.
