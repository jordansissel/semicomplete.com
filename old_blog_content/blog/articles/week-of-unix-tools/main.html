      <p></p>

      The goal of these articles is to give you many real examples of each tool
      being used.
    <h4><a name="id2244828">Intended Audience</a></h4>
      These are not "newbie guides" by any means. They're really geared towards
      people who have probably seen these tools before, can pick up new tools
      quickly by learning-through-example, and probably won't be reading the
      manpage any time soon.
