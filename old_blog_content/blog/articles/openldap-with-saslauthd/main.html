    Problem with SASL/GSSAPI is that address book clients aren't going to
    support much beyond simple authentication over SSL. Thusly, we need a way
    to use a simple bind over SSL and still authenticate against Kerberos.

    <p></p>

    The LDAP Server's slapd.conf has the following to translate between gssapi
    auth DNs and real user object DNs:

    <pre>
    authz-policy from
    authz-regexp "^uid=([^,]+),cn=gssapi,cn=auth" "uid=$1,ou=Users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu"
    </pre>

    This allows GSSAPI authentication:

    <pre>nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami
SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error (-2)
        additional info: SASL(-1): generic failure: GSSAPI Error:  Miscellaneous failure (see text) (open(/tmp/krb5cc_1001): No such file or directory)

nightfall(~) !1! % kinit psionic
psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU's Password: 
kinit: NOTICE: ticket renewable lifetime is 0
nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami
SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
SASL username: psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU
SASL SSF: 56
SASL installing layers
dn:uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
Result: Success (0)</pre>

    I have a TGT and can authenticate to LDAP over SASL (my ldap.conf defaults
    to sasl+ssl). However, when you try to do a simple bind:

    <pre>nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami -x -D 'uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu' -W 
Enter LDAP Password: 
ldap_bind: Invalid credentials</pre>

    On the slapd side, you'll see errors like:

    <pre>==&gt; bdb_bind: dn: uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
SASL Canonicalize [conn=0]: authcid="psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU"
SASL Canonicalize [conn=0]: authcid="psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU"
SASL [conn=0] Failure: Could not open db
SASL [conn=0] Failure: Could not open db</pre>

    Googling around will tell you that lots of people put the following in
    their "slapd.conf" files:

    <pre>pwcheck_method: saslauthd
saslauthd_path: /var/run/saslauthd/mux</pre>

    Now, you'll recognize that this format of "token: value" doesn't match the
    normal slapd.conf. There's a reason for this: This isn't OpenLDAP's slapd.conf
    file. It's the config file for SASL! From what I gather, saslauthd is working
    similarly to the way PAM works, in that it sees a service trying to use it and
    uses that particular service's config file. I believe saslauthd comes with a
    standard Sendmail.conf for example usage.

    <p></p>

    It took me several hours to find this fact out. My slapd SERVER config file
    is located here:
    <br>
    /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf
    <p></p>

    While the SASL (saslauthd) "slapd.conf" authentication config file is located here:
    <br>
    /usr/local/lib/sasl2/slapd.conf
    <p></p>

    If you can't find the right place, look for 'Sendmail.conf' somewhere near
    where you installed sasl or saslauthd.

    <p></p>

    Anyway, once we've added this magic config file and told it to use saslauthd,
    the SASL library LDAP's slapd is using will now attempt communication with
    saslauthd over the /var/run/saslauthd/mux socket. I ran saslauthd like this:

    <pre>
/usr/local/sbin/saslauthd -a kerberos5 -d
    </pre>

    The directory, /var/run/saslauthd was owned by 'cyrus' and I changed the group
    ownership to 'ldap' so that the slapd server (running as 'ldap') could access
    the socket. This is a necessary step, else you will get Permission Denied
    errors permissions disallow you from accessing the socket or its directory.

    <p></p>

    Now, once we have saslauthd running, the sasl library slapd.conf, and the moons
    aligned, we can perform a simple bind:

    <pre>
nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami -x -D 'uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu' -W 
Enter LDAP Password: 
dn:uid=psionic,ou=Users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
Result: Success (0)
    </pre>

    saslauthd, in debug mode, will say something meaningful such as:

    <pre>
saslauthd[28910] :do_auth         : auth success: [user=psionic] [service=ldap] [realm=CSH.RIT.EDU] [mech=kerberos5]
saslauthd[28910] :do_request      : response: OK
    </pre>

    Whew! My LDAP Authentication journey is complete. I am elated that gssapi
    and simple binds both work for eventually authenticating against our
    Kerberos server. I'd post my configs, but the system this was working on
    died and I didn't have a backup.
