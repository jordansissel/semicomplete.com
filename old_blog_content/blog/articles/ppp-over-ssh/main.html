      The gist of it is as follows: My laptop is on an insecure, wireless,
      untrusted network. I want my traffic to be more secure, so people can't
      gather anything useful out of my packets they sniff over the air. My
      server is on a more trusted network, so that's where I'll want to tunnel
      all of my traffic. From there, my traffic will hit the Internet or
      whatever it's intended destination may be.

      <p></p>

      Special mentions should be made: If I refer to
      <i>client</i>, I'm talking about my laptop. If I refer to
      <i>gateway</i>, I'm referring to my endpoint server on the
      trusted network.

    <h4><a name="id2244853">What do I need to do?</a></h4>
      There are many steps here, make sure you do all of them :)
      <h4><a name="id2244857">You need root</a></h4>
<p>
        Before you can actually run ppp(8), you must have root on both
        the client and gateway machines. Make sure you do.
        </p>
<h4><a name="id2244866">Create an ssh key</a></h4>
<p>
        First, you're going to need a passphraseless ssh key so we can login to your vpn gateway without a password. You do this by using the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command.
        </p>
<pre>ssh-keygen -N "" -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/ppp.key</pre>
<p>
        This should create two files, a public and private key:
        <code>~/.ssh/ppp.key</code> and <code>~/.ssh/ppp.key.pub</code>. The
        first one is your private key, you'll need to keep that on your client
        machine. The public key needs to go on your gateway (vpn endpoint).
        Assuming your end point is running OpenSSH, you need to copy
        the contents of your public key into
        <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the gateway server.
        That's all you need to do for ssh keys right now , I'll come back to the key later.
        </p>
<h4><a name="id2244963">Client ppp.conf</a></h4>
<p>
        The next file you want to look at is
        <code>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</code>. This is where FreeBSD's
        ppp(8) looks for it's configuration. You need to add a new
        entry, I called mine <code>vpn</code>. Here i what I used:
        </p>
<pre>
vpn:
  set ifaddr 192.168.10.2 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.255
  set dial 
  set device "!env SSH_AUTH_SOCK= ssh -C -c blowfish -i /home/psionic/.ssh/ppp.key psionic@129.21.61.7"
        </pre>

        Remeber, this configuration is for the <i>client</i> only.
        The first line tells ppp to create a tunnel between
        192.168.10.2 and 192.168.10.1. The first IP on this line is
         the desired IP of the <i>client</i> on your new private
         network. The second address is the target IP of the tunnel,
         which is the gateway.

        <p></p>

        These two IPs can be different, as long as they are on the
        same subnet and are in the nonroutable range. It'd work
        cleaner aswell if you didn't pick a subnet already in use in
        either end of your network, if any are in use at all.

        <p></p>

        The only special note here, is the <code>device</code> used
        in this ppp session. It is not a device, but ppp is told to
        execute ssh(1) and use it as a transport medium. It will ssh
        to 129.21.61.7 with the private key we created in the last
        step.

      <h4><a name="id2244998">Gateway ppp.conf</a></h4>
        The <code>ppp.conf</code> configuration for the
        <i>gateway</i> is much simpler. Again, I called the new
        section <code>vpn</code>. Here:

        <pre>
vpn:
  set ifaddr 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.255
        </pre>

        Again, the first ip in that line is the desired private
        ip of <i>this</i> machine, which is the gateway this
        time. Remember above when we set the client's ip to
        192.168.10.2 and the tunnel endpoint ip to 192.168.10.1?
      <h4><a name="id2245020">More ssh key business</a></h4>
        I said we'd come back to the ssh key, right? You should now have your
        private key on the client as
        <code>~/.ssh/ppp.key</code> and have put the contents of the public key
        (<code>~/.ssh/ppp.key.pub</code>) into the <i>gateway</i>'s
        <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file.  You can verify that this key
        is working by doing:

        <pre> ssh -i ~/.ssh/ppp.key <i>yourgatewayserver</i></pre>

        If it lets you login without prompting for a password, then you've done
        it right. If it doesn't work, then you probably didn't copy the public
        key properly or at all. Check the permissions of the .ssh directory and
        the authorized_keys file on the gateway. .ssh should be 0700 and
        authorized_keys should be 0600.

        <p></p>

        Assuming all goes well, we'll need to tell the gateway to execute a
        specific command for the key we are using. Your current
        <code>authorized_keys</code> file should have something looking vaguely
        like this:

        <pre> ssh-rsa AAAAB....lotsofcharacters...= psionic@somehostname </pre>

        We need to add a command section now. Add this:

        <pre><b>command="op pppvpn"</b> ssh-rsa AAAAB...etc...</pre>

        All you add is a <code>command="op pppvpn"</code> to the beginning of
        the line. That command is just what it looks like: when you login with
        the key you created, it will run "op pppvpn" regardless of what command
        you try to run, or even if you try to get a login shell. This secures
        your <i>gateway</i> by greatly limiting what can be done should your
        private key become compromised. Granted, with a ppp connection they'll
        be able to pretend they are coming from your <i>gateway</i> server, but
        they won't get access to the machine itself.
      <h4><a name="id2245069">Installing 'op'</a></h4>

        You don't have to do this. I use op to run things as root.  It's
        similar to <code>sudo</code>, but I think it's easier to configure.
        Anyway, I have an entry in my <code>op.access</code>:

        <pre>pppvpn  /usr/sbin/ppp -direct vpn; users=psionic environment</pre>

        This means that when I (psionic) type "<code>op pppvpn</code>", then op
        will run "<code>/usr/sbin/ppp -direct vpn</code>" as root for me.

        <p></p>

        You can alternatively use sudo or put your public key in your root
        user's .ssh/authorized_keys and ssh to the server as root. Either way,
        you need to be able to ssh to your <i>gateway</i> from your
        <i>client</i> and attain root privileges so you can run
        <code>ppp</code>(8) on the <i>gateway</i>.

      <h4><a name="id2245110">Let's test it!</a></h4>

      Everything should be setup now:
      <ul>
<li> ppp.conf on the client </li>
<li> ppp.conf on the gateway </li>
<li> ssh key with public/private parts put in the right places </li>
<li> root access attainable through ssh login on the gateway
        with the ssh key </li>
</ul>

      We can now try starting our vpn, as root on the <i>client</i>, type:

      <pre>ppp -auto vpn</pre>

      Now try pinging the <i>gateway</i> ip, which if you remember should be
      192.168.10.1 (unless you set it differently).

      <pre>
nightfall(~) [1012] % sudo ppp -auto vpn
Password:
Working in auto mode
Using interface: tun0
nightfall(~) [1013] % ping 192.168.10.1
PING 192.168.10.1 (192.168.10.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.10.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=2.672 ms
^C
</pre>

      Works! Now, how do you get traffic to go through this tunnel?
      Use routes. An example would be if I wanted all my google.com
      traffic to go through the tunnel:

      <pre>
nightfall(~) [1001] % sudo route add 216.239.39.99 192.168.10.1
add host 216.239.39.99: gateway 192.168.10.1
nightfall(~) [1002] % sudo route add 216.239.57.99 192.168.10.1
add host 216.239.57.99: gateway 192.168.10.1
nightfall(~) [1003] % sudo route add 216.239.37.99 192.168.10.1
add host 216.239.37.99: gateway 192.168.10.1

nightfall(~) [1004] % traceroute google.com
traceroute: Warning: google.com has multiple addresses; using 216.239.57.99
traceroute to google.com (216.239.57.99), 64 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1  192.168.10.1 (192.168.10.1)  2.589 ms  1.707 ms  1.728 ms
 2  rit-core1-vlan60.rit.edu (129.21.61.232)  2.673 ms  2.197 ms  1.966 ms
 3  rit-rit1-pp-core1-vlan807.rit.edu (129.21.8.25)  2.724 ms  2.607 ms  2.203 ms
 ...
</pre>

    And we're all done! You can see that the first route goes to
    192.168.10.1.

    <h4><a name="id2245150">Summary</a></h4>
      So now you know how to tunel with ppp using ssh as transport. If
      something in this article is unclear or you need more information, shoot
      me an email and I'll try and clear it up for you :)
