      Simply using <code>/bin/false</code> as someone's shell does not keep
      them from using said account to authenticate over ssh and using non-shell
      tools such as port forwarding. A default configuration in sshd will often
      allow tunneling and other non-shell activity.
    <h4><a name="id54118">Hole #1: Potential Firewall Bypass</a></h4>
<p>
    So, to make things more interesting, there are two obvious holes I can
    exploit here. The first, is firewall-bypass. ITS employs lots of ACLs
    limiting access to machines by IP ranges. This is a normal practice
    in the world. However, what if the machine I am port forwarding
    through is one of these trusted machines? You just gave me access to
    your supposedly locked-down network. Don't do that.
    </p>
<h4><a name="id54130">Hole #2: Anonymous traffic</a></h4>
<p>
      I can make my traffic far more anonymous by using ssh's port-forward
      or SOCKS proxy feature. OpenSSH does not appear to log
      port-forward-only sessions, so chances are you can get away with using
      this half-secured server as a proxy. I haven't done all the research,
      but ssh port-forward-only sessions only seem to show up in process
      listings and not standard audit logs. This stuff needs to be logged if
      you're going to allow it.
    </p>
<h4><a name="id54143">Hole #3: Resource Starvation</a></h4>
<p>
    The third one is less obvious, but quite easy. You setup a remote port
    forward (<i>ssh -R</i>) pointed at "itself" (the machine you're logging into)
    and then a local port forward (<i>ssh -L</i>) to the machine so you can just
    touch it with telnet and walk away. This creates a large problem on the
    end machine becuase you will eventually take up all the available file
    descriptors, and since unix lives on file descriptors, you just DoS'd
    the machine. So if some naughty person manages to guess a password of one of 
    your 30000 users, he/she can happily perform resource starvation attacks 'till
    the end of the day despite your wishes that I stay off your machine. Like
    I said, <b>/bin/false is not security</b>.
    </p>
<h4><a name="id54169">Example DoS</a></h4>
<p>
      I used 3 xterms for this (wow, high-tech!). I could've used one shell,
      but I like seeing debug output.
    </p>
<pre>
(terminal 1) whack% ssh -vN -L4141:localhost:4141 kenya
(terminal 2) whack% ssh -vN -R4141:localhost:4141 kenya
(terminal 3) whack% telnet localhost 4141
</pre>
<p>
    I use <i>ssh -v</i> because I want to see what's going on. As soon as I
    execute the telnet command, the other two terminals are flooded with
    debug information detailing new port forwarded connections happening,
    etc. Since you've just created a loop, you can now kill the telnet
    session and the loop maintains it's stability.
    </p>
<p>
    Simply wait a few minutes and you'll fill up the openfiles table.
    </p>
<h4><a name="id54197">Why does the DoS work?</a></h4>
<p>
    How is this DoS accomplished? Well besides whoring CPU some and slowly
    increasing in memory usage, you chew up entries on the system's open
    file table. During this test, I checked the growth of the number of open
    file descriptors on kenya (the "target" of our DoS):
    </p>
<pre>
kenya(~) [1003] % while :; do sysctl kern.openfiles; sleep 1; done
kern.openfiles: 242
kern.openfiles: 242
kern.openfiles: 278
kern.openfiles: 652
kern.openfiles: 896
kern.openfiles: 1082
kern.openfiles: 1246
</pre>
<p>
    The number was stable at 242 before the attack began, and rose rapidly.
    If you don't speak bourne, the numbers are printed one per second. So
    the increase is something like 100-300 file descriptors per second. That
    is quite significant, and will very quickly hose a host. Notably, there
    is a rapid decelleration in the number of files opened per second, but it
    steadies (for me) around 20-30 per second after about 7000 open sockets.
    </p>
<h4><a name="id54221">Fixing It</a></h4>
<p>
        The systems in question were old old Solaris 7 or Tru64 systems. Modern
        systems will generally have a pam module that will help you here -
        possibly allowing you to reject authentication requests over ssh simply
        because the user's shell is set to /bin/false, or /usr/sbin/nologin (or
        wherever that is on your system).
      </p>
<p>
        Other solutions include fixing your sshd config to do any of the
        following (assumes OpenSSH and possibly SSH.com sshd):
        <ul>
<li> Restrict which users are allowed via AllowUsers or AllowGroups </li>
<li> Deny tunneling/forwarding: AllowTcpForwarding, X11Forwarding, PermitTunnel </li>
</ul></p>
<h4><a name="id54249">Mentionable Notes</a></h4>
<p>
    ssh sessions not requesting shells (<i>ssh -N</i>) do not show up in
    utmp, therefore are not listed in w(1) output, and not in last(1), etc.
    Unless there's a more in-depth audit log, you just made your traffic
    atleast somewhat anonymous (assuming you're actually port-forwarding).
    So go ahead and abuse that.
    </p>
<p>
    Chance are, if someone gives you an account and tries to prevent ssh
    access with only /bin/false, they probably don't know about ssh2 or
    channels, or haven't thought about how it might not prevent all ssh
    access. So there's a high probability that you'll get away with it
    forwarding traffic or DoS'ing the server.
