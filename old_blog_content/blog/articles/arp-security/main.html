      In any case, much of this article is probably common knowledge in the
      security community. However, it was new to me as I was discovering and
      researching it; so here it is. All of the research here was through
      trial and error, and I broke the network a few times ;)
    <h4><a name="id2244828">ARP, IPs, and You</a></h4>
      My first hunch for why this works was to blame the network hardware
      (switches, etc). Turns out I was wrong. Let's start from the beginning!
      <p></p>
      So, I start off by assuming someone else's ip address:
      <pre>ifconfig rl0 inet 192.168.15.1</pre>

      What happens when I do that? Watching tcpdump in another window:
      <pre>17:25:40.216489 00:50:ba:15:19:0d &gt; Broadcast, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 60: arp who-has 192.168.15.1 tell 192.168.15.1</pre>

      Can't decipher tcpdump output? That's ok. When I set my IP to
      '192.168.15.1' my operating system sends out an arp "who-has" packet
      seeing if anyone else has this IP. So why is this important?

      <p></p>

      When <i>any</i> computer on the network receives this kind of packet,
      it puts an entry in a table called the ARP table. The ARP table maps IP
      addresses to MAC addresses. This kind of packet is a broadcast arp
      packet that has the same "who-has" IP address as "tell" IP address. The
      problem with very dynamic networks is that the likelihood of anything
      on the network having any static (permanent) arp entries is very low.
      Translation: You can poison hosts and network devices with little
      effort.

      <p></p>

      How can we make the process of poisoning easier? We can use <a href="http://nemesis.sourceforge.net">nemesis</a>, a packet injection
      tool, to help us out. Instead of using OS tools to set our IP, we can
      use nemesis to poison networked devices.

    <h4><a name="id2244855">Nemesis for Arp Poisoning</a></h4>
      Remember that packet that we sent out when we changed our IP? Well we
      can spoof it with nemesis.

      <pre>
nemesis arp -S 192.168.100.100 -D 192.168.100.100 \ 
            -H 00:de:ad:be:ef:00 -h 01:de:ad:be:ef:00</pre>

      This will broadcast an arp "who-has" packet on the network and pretty
      much every machine will happily update their arp tables with your new
      entry for the ip <i>192.168.100.100</i> and the mac address of
      <i>00:de:ad:be:ef:00</i>.

      <p></p>

      So let's put this to use on an existing host on our network:
      <pre>
kenya% arp 192.168.100.100 
? (192.168.100.100) at 00:0c:f1:2e:2b:95 on tl0 [ethernet]
... meanwhile, I'm being evil ...
whack% sudo nemesis arp -S 192.168.100.100 -D 192.168.100.100 \ 
            -H 00:de:ad:be:ef:00 -h 00:de:ad:be:ef:00
... and back on the other machine ...
kenya% arp 192.168.100.100
? (192.168.100.100) at 00:de:ad:be:ef:00 on tl0 [ethernet] </pre>

    Note how the mac addresses are different after I poison the network. This
    technique is wonderfully simple. Most (all?) machines and network devices
    on the network should now be convinced that <i>00:de:ad:be:ef:00</i> is
    the proper mac address for the ip <i>192.168.100.100</i><p></p>
    Now that we've poisoned the network, we can sniff traffic and see that
    packets that were intended on the "real" <i>192.168.100.100</i> are now
    coming to us because the switches know that <i>00:de:ad:be:ef:00</i> is
    us. The added benefit, is that our real mac address is not
    <i>00:de:ad:be:ef:00</i>. Audits logs will not track us easily, especially
    on large-user networks with several unmanaged switches.
    <h4><a name="id2244964">Attack: Local DoS</a></h4>
      If your network uses dhcp with dynamic dns, you can very easily track
      someone and keep them from gaining network access if you are on the
      same network segment (wireless networks, anyone?). This simple
      scriptlet will keep a particular host offline as long as it's running:
      <pre>while true; do 
  nemesis arp -S poorsap -D poorsap \ 
    -H 00:de:ad:be:ef:00 -h 00:de:ad:be:ef:00
  sleep 1
done</pre>
      Once a second, I'll claim I am <i>poorsap</i>. Every time this person
      does dhcp and it updates dns, nemesis will look up the hostname and
      send out the packet on the network claiming that another machine is
      actually <i>poorsap</i>. No one will send packets to the real
      <i>poorsap</i> because they think it's mac address is elsewhere.
      Furthermore, if the OS panics and does a dhcp release/renew sequence,
      the dns entry will update and it'll kick it off a new IP address, if
      any. This has other benefits I'll mention in the next section
    <h4><a name="id2244984">Attack: Man in the Middle</a></h4>
      There are two flavors of this kind of attack: Local and Remote. I don't
      want to get in a religious war with security pedants about semantics,
      but for this situation, <i>local</i> means the local network segment
      (layer 2), and <i>remote</i> means outside the local network.

      <p></p>

      There are two styles of each attack: The first being where you
      broadcast arp changes to the local net to convince everyone on the
      local segment that there is a new mac address for a given IP. The
      second is where you convince only an individual host that a mac address
      has changed for a given IP.

      <p></p>

      The first attack, local, is where you convince a network or a host that
      you are someone else on the local segment. Traffic intended for the
      target host will go to you. 
      
      <p></p>
      
      The second attack, remote, is where you convince a network or a host
      that you are the gateway. Traffic intended for outbound delivery will
      try to go through you. Feel free to sniff their outbound traffic such
      as authentication, aim conversations, etc. More on this later

      <p></p>

      You get the idea, arp poisoning is too easy to do on normal host
      machines. And on dynamic networks, it's very likely that local-segment
      routers will have to listen to arp updates.

    <h4><a name="id2245006">Simple MITM Script</a></h4>
      I'm lazy. I'll be the first to admit it. So in lazy efforts, I wrote a
      script to automate the task of poisoning hosts and routers. You can 
      <a href="/articles/arp-security/arpmitm"> grab arpmitm here</a>. 
      You can repair your changes once you've played around with it enough
      by using the '-r' option along with the original -v and -g options.

      <p></p>

      I can simply do this:
      <pre>./arpmitm -v poorsap -g gateway_ip</pre>

      And viola! All of poorsap's traffic is going through me, both inbound
      and outbound. Makes you feel safe about your network eh? Hell, Windows
      doesn't even log arp table changes as far as I know. I tried this
      against a friend's Windows XP machine, and there was nothing about it
      in the event viewer logs. Therefore, any normal user will be completely
      oblivious to the fact that their computer just agreed to route traffic
      through you. Fantastic design, eh?

      <p></p>

      The clear benefit here is that I can now sniff your traffic without
      being in promiscuous mode. Promiscuous mode is detectable in certain
      environments depending on the promiscuous node's OS, drivers, etc.
      Furthermore, I've found that wireless cards stop being able to function
      normally while in promiscuous mode. Kill both of those birds with one
      stone by doing this method.

    <h4><a name="id2245027">Getting more complex</a></h4>
      Add a firewall rule or two for nat and port redirection (FreeBSD PF):
      <pre>
nat on ndis0 from !ndis0 to any -&gt; 129.21.61.3
rdr pass on ndis0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; cnn.com port 80
      </pre>

      Turn on pf, load those rules, and run arpmitm on someone. All their web traffic will point them to 'cnn.com' regardless of the destination host. The poor user tries to go to google.com, and cnn.com comes up. Brilliantly simple.
    <h4><a name="id2245035">Prevention</a></h4>
      The danger from this kind of attack is clear. It seems the only way to
      protect against this is to use static (permanent) arp entries in both
      the router and client hosts. However, it needs to be mentioned that
      using static arp entries will never scale even in small environments
      (less than 5 servers) becuase you'll have to update all servers
      whenever an entry needs changing. PITA, more work that it's worth.

      <p></p>

      Static arp entries can be set in most operating systems with the
      following command:
      <pre>arp -s [ip_address] [mac_address]</pre>

      If you do this, then your arp table will now have a permanent entry in
      it. It might be a good idea if you had a dhcp-client hook script that
      set a static arp entry for the gateway after every successful dhcp
      request. That assumes, however, that you are getting a dhcp address
      from a trustworthy dhcp server. If someone's put up an evil dhcp
      server, that's a whole other ball game I won't be covering in this
      article.

      <p></p>

      Forgetting dhcp-client hosts for the moment, let's focus on servers.
      If your environment is such that server ip addresses never change,
      then you may benefit from static arp entries. However, if IPs or
      network interfaces change more than never, static entries are a waste
      of effort and will just serve as a point of breakage. Unfortunately in
      a larger environment, servers may change more often than never, so
      setting static entries, again, is way more effort than it is worth. 

      <p></p>
      Anyway, most switches can have static arp entries for servers mapping
      the server's mac address to the switch port where the server is
      connected.  Furthermore, all servers can also have static arp entries
      of other servers as well as static entries for any gateway hosts.

      <p></p>

      Another way to fix this is to rethink your network layout. Have your
      important servers on a secure subnet with limited access. This includes
      limiting both physical and remote access. If I can't get on the local
      segment, I can't poison your machines.

    <h4><a name="id2245053">Conclusion</a></h4>
      The ease of this style of attack worries me. For those of you who
      already know about it and have worked with it before: How else can you
      prevent this?
