  <h4><a name="id2255991">Why use Grok?</a></h4>
    My servers get hit with brute-force ssh login attempts almost every day.
    They're also hit with several exploit attempts on varying protocols
    daily.  Chances are all Internet-facing systems will see this on a
    regular basis. I've never had a successful break in, but why give script
    kiddies a chance?

    <p></p>
    My logs end up riddled with line after line of failed logins, etc. So I
    needed a system that could watch the logs

    <p></p>
    Failed login attempts are logged in <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> on
    FreeBSD, so that's where I'll be looking for patterns to match. An
    example of a failed login attempt is this:

    <pre>
Apr 30 22:19:32 kenya sshd[76279]: Failed password for illegal user test from 61.30.94.124 port 36884
</pre>

    This is an illegal login attempt for a username 'test' - this means there
    is no user 'test' on that server. I have made the assumption that no one
    will try to login to this machine with an invalid username more than once
    or twice in a short while, so that will be my criteria for blocking these
    script-kiddie login attempts.

    <p></p>
    Enter grok. This is a short perl program I wrote that allows you to
    configure reactions to certain patterns.  The configuration file format
    is pretty straight forward, in my opinion.

    <p></p>
    A sample configuration follows:
<pre>
file "/var/log/auth.log" {
  type "bad username" {
    match = "Illegal user %USERNAME% from %IP%";
    threshold = 4;
    interval = 300;
    reaction = "pfctl -t whores -T add %IP%";
  };
};
</pre>

    This will look for patterns matching the 'match' part of the
    configuration above. So, for example, if the following appears in the log
    file:

<pre>
Apr 24 07:15:37 kenya sshd[44889]: Illegal user admin from 193.195.96.6
</pre>

    The match will be triggered and a count will be increased. If the
    threshold ever hits 4 in 300 seconds, the "reaction" will be executed. It
    will run <code>pfctl -t whores -T add 193.195.96.6</code>, which will add
    that IP to the 'whores' table in pf. Here is the pertinent section of my
    <code>pf.conf</code>:

<pre>
table &lt;whores&gt; persist file "/etc/pf.whores"

# Block whores.
block in log quick on $ext_if from &lt;whores&gt; to any
block out log quick on $ext_if from any to &lt;whores&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>
    I find this to be pretty useful in helping to keep my machine free of
    brute-force attempts.

    <hr>
<h4><a name="id2255994">More advanced usage</a></h4>
    The latest update to grok added support for more descriptively named
    pattern captures. This is an extremely necessary feature if you have
    multiple of the same patterns that need to be matched.

    <p></p>

    Example:
<pre>
exec "tcpdump -li tl0 -n 2&gt; /dev/null" {
  type "ssh-connect" {
    match = "%IP:SRC%.\d+ &gt; %IP:DST%.22: S";
    reaction = "echo 'SSH connect(): %IP:SRC% -&gt; %IP:DST%'";
  };
};

</pre>

    This will run tcpdump and grok the output for new connections to port 22.
    Sample output is as follows:
<pre>
SSH connect(): 192.168.2.1 -&gt; 192.168.50.4
SSH connect(): 192.168.4.8 -&gt; 192.168.50.4
SSH connect(): 192.168.4.3 -&gt; 192.168.50.4
</pre>

    This, immediately, may not seem useful. However, you'll note that grok is
    able to parse tcpdump output with very little effort on your part. Here's
    another example, where we look for port scans using the new 'key'
    feature:

<pre>
exec "tcpdump -li tl0 -n 2&gt; /dev/null" {
  type "port-scan" {
    match = "%IP:SRC%.%PORT% &gt; %IP:DST%.%PORT:DST%: S";

    # Store each "hit" by source ip only
    key = "%IP:SRC%";

    threshold = 30;
    interval = 5;
    reaction = "echo 'Port scan from %IP:SRC%'";
  };
};
</pre>

    I then run 'nmap -sT' against this host:

<pre>
Port scan from 129.21.61.220
Port scan from 129.21.61.220
Port scan from 129.21.61.220
Port scan from 129.21.61.220
Port scan from 129.21.61.220
</pre>

    grok is not a substitute for IDS software, nor is it IDS software, but
    the point of the above demonstrations are to show the usefulness of both
    the better capture naming and key generation. However, you may find it
    useful to use grok for IDS-type activities.
