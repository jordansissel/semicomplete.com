		It's a very simple program that simple takes certain packets and forwards
		them to other known xbox proxies. The xbox system link bridge will let
		you essentially bridge the broadcast and multicast traffic across
		multiple networks using these proxy bridge-points.

	<h4><a name="id45944">How does it work?</a></h4>
		The xbox system link uses ethernet addresses (Layer 2) to indicate
		destination address and UDP (Layer 4) to send data. If you aren't
		familiar with the OSI model, then the layer information won't help you
		here. Basically, the 3 layers we care about for this system link proxy
		are ethernet (layer 2) and udp (layer 4). There's a special mention for
		the ip layer (layer 3) but that will be explained shortly.

		<p></p>
		System link packets come in two flavors: broadcast and unicast. In Halo
		2, when you go to look for system link games, your xbox will send
		ethernet broadcast packets probing for available games. Broadcast packets
		are received by every network device on your layer 2 segment, this
		usually means your subnet or immediate network. Other xbox systems who
		are hosting games will respond directly to your xbox using your xbox's
		ethernet address (MAC address) as the destination. This process is called
		"discovery." After the discovery process completes and your xbox knows
		about other xboxes hosting games on the network, it begins direct
		communication to the known xboxes. When you try to join a game, your xbox
		sends packets directly to the other xbox you are connecting to. Direct
		communication continues until you quit the game.

		<p></p>
		A special note needs to be made, becuase you can't simple skip over layer
		3 (the ip layer). We know now that addressed communication uses ethernet
		addresses, and we also know that the payloads are inside UDP packets, but
		what about the IP layer? The IP layer has addresses of its own, among
		other kinds of flags. Xboxes use the IP of 0.0.0.1 to communicate. This
		is nothing *too* special, but if you want to sniff only your xbox's
		traffic, then you can simply filter for that ip and you'll get it.

		<p></p>
		The proxy works by listening for broadcast packets from any xboxes on the
		immediate network. Any broadcast packets are forwarded to any known
		proxies over UDP. The proxy also keeps track of ethernet addresses by
		proxy. So if a packet from "my" xbox wants to talk to another xbox, the
		proxy will know which proxy that target xbox is on, and only forward the
		packet to that proxy.

		<p></p>
		This is a very simple system, and I don't have to know anything about the
		system link protocol beyond what the underlying layers are used for
		communication.

		<p></p>
		I later did some investigating into iTunes music shares. iTunes uses mdns
		(Apple calls it Rendezvous) for "discovery" of other iTunes music shares.
		The discovery is done over a protocol called multicast. Adding mdns
		support to the proxy/bridge program was quite trivial, and I have tested
		that it does in-fact work. You can use it to listen to iTunes music
		shares which are not on your immediate network.
