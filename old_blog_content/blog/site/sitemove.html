I'll be moving this site to my new domain as soon as I get things setup there. I won't bother disclosing the name at this point, seeing as how there's nothing there.

<p>

As a hint, however, I will say I came up with the name using this perl one-liner:

<pre>
perl -Mre=eval -ne 'print if m/^s(.)(??{"[^$1]+$1"}){2}$/' words
</pre>

(are your eyes bleeding, yet?)

<p>

That regex will find all valid sed substitution expressions in the file 'words'
(freebsd's dictionary file). So, anything printed by that perl code will be
valid as a sed command. ie: "streetlet" is valid as 

<pre>% echo "ree" | sed -e "streetlet"
le
</pre>

I learned a new word in the process of running this script. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define: syzygy">syzygy</a>

<p>

Nothing quite like using perl to choose a domain name for you. Yeah, I'm a dork.
