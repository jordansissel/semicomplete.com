Lack of updates due to all energy being spent on upgrades/fixes to my new
house! Sorry folks ;)

<p>

Having <a href="/blog/geekery/merging-multiple-svn-repos">recently merged all
of my code repositories</a> into one single subversion repository, I decided it
was time to look into running a web-based interface to it.

<p>

Looks like some short time ago ViewCVS (like cvsweb) was rewritten to support
different version control systems and renamed to <a
href="http://www.viewvc.org/">ViewVC</a>. It's dead easy to configure, so
within minutes I had a happy web-based view into my new, single, repository.

<p>

<a href="/svnweb">Go to my svn repo</a>
<p>

This repository contains most of the code I've ever written (excluding (job and
school)-related stuff). Looking back at it now, there's code in there I haven't
touched in years.
<p>

One of those is rssnews, which I wrote to teach myself perl back in 2002. The
rewrite barely got started but made its way into source control. Seems funny
now, where there are entire dot com businesses built around serving syndicated
feeds, that I wonder where I might be if I had continued to maintain it? Surely
I'd be a millionaire ;)

<p>

Another is 'diesel', a project I started to make automagic configuration of
CSH's new FWSM context easy. I only finished the first part, which was an
expect script which would read a config file in and install it into the
firewall over ssh. CSH recently added a user-configurable web tool that allows
members to configure firewall access rules for their registered machines. It
uses this expect script to set rules, last I recall.

<p>

Good times. Oh, and I found this neat site the other day:
<br>
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/">http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/</a>

<p>

It has some decent writing. Brian Jones makes some good points in <a
href="http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/blog/2007/04/sys_admins_books_and_trending.html">this
piece</a> about sysadmins and technical books; that sysadmins are starting to
lean towards writing more code than simple administrative tasks. He (I think it
was him) also talks about how programming methodolgies have become more popular
and adopted and questions why no common-practice sysadmin methodologies have
risen.
