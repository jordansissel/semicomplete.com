I needed a neat way to write and present articles. I got bored and wrote a
little xsl script that turns my happy new article xml into some html-ish stuff.
So far it's looking very cool. For instance, it will do automatic
table-of-contents generation with proper anchor tags, etc.

I'll post more on this later when it's finished. I'd finish it tonight, but I'm tired.
