The following projects stuff I'd like to put time into during spring break.
These are in no particular order of preference.

<ul>
<li> templating system for the stats aggregator with logwatcher </li>
<li> jquery sort() plugin </li>
<li> get newpsm/newmoused into FreeBSD -CURRENT </li>
<li> pam_captcha code audit </li>
</ul>

Whether or not I actually get around to doing any of this is still in question.
