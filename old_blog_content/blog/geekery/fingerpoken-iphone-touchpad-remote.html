I'm giving a presentation this week at the <a
href="http://bay-area-meetup.eventbrite.com/">Puppet Bay Area user meetup</a>
and while working on slides, I wanted to be able to present while not being
attached to my laptop.

<p>

Enter: fingerpoken

<p>

Fingerpoken lets you turn your iphone/ipad/itouch into a touchpad, keyboard,
and remote for another computer. The only required piece on your iphone is
Safari. No appstore stuff to download!

<p>

Under the hood, it uses websockets and touch events and sends JSON-encoded
requests to your workstation and will move the mouse, type, scroll, and more.
