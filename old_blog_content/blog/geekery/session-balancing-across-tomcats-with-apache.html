You can scale tomcat webapps somewhat well using session affinity and load
distribution. But how? Apache to the rescue.

<p>

For each tomcat server, modify the server.xml and change the value for
'jvmRoute' to the ip address of the tomcat server. Example:

<pre>
  &lt;Engine name="Standalone" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="192.168.0.10">
</pre>

This affects the last token in your <i>jsessionid</i> cookie. Visiting my tomcat, my cookie gets set to the following:

<blockquote>
C40ABF646B07162A621856F459977E9B.<b>192.168.0.10</b>
</blockquote>

<p>

Use apache's mod_rewrite to use apache as a frontend to your tomcat servers. That is, use apache as a reverse proxy.  In your httpd.conf:

<p>

<pre>
RewriteMap SERVERS rnd:/etc/httpd/conf/frontends.conf
RewriteCond "%{HTTP_COOKIE}"          "(^|;\s*)JSESSIONID=\w*\.([0-9.]+)($|;)"
RewriteRule "^(.*)"                   "http://%2:8080%{REQUEST_URI}"  [P,L]
RewriteRule "^.*;jsessionid=\w*\.([0-9.]+)($|;)"  "http://$1:8080%{REQUEST_URI}"  [P,L]
RewriteRule "^(.*)"                    "http://${SERVERS:ALL}:8080%{REQUEST_URI}" [P,L]
</pre>

This technique is quite similar to the one <a
href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/balancer-howto.html">on
tomcat.apache.org</a> in the docs, but I think it's better. Why? Less files to
modify when you add or remove tomcat servers means less complexity, less errors
and less effort.

<p>
<ol>
  <li> <code>RewriteCond "%{HTTP_COOKIE}"          "(^|;\s*)JSESSIONID=\w*\.([0-9.]+)($|;)"</code>
    <br>
    If a jsessionid cookie is found, go to #2 and store match groups (backreferences) as %1, %2, etc.
  </li>
  <li> <code> RewriteRule "^(.*)"                   "http://%2:8080%{REQUEST_URI}"  [P,L] </code>
    <br>
    Session Affinity: Redirect everything using an internal proxy request to the 2nd group
    matched in the previous RewriteCond. Since we use the IP as the jvmRoute,
    that's what is matched, and your request is proxied to the server that gave
    you your cookie.
  </li>
  <li> <code> RewriteRule "^.*;jsessionid=\w*\.([0-9.]+)($|;)"  "http://$1:8080%{REQUEST_URI}"  [P,L] </code>
    <br>
    Session affinity: Tomcat likes to add (who knows why?) ";jsessionid=blah" to the end of the
    url when it first sets you up the cookie. In case no cookie is found, this
    will proxy your request to the proper server just like the previous rule.
  </li>
  <li> <code> RewriteRule "^(.*)"                    "http://${SERVERS:ALL}:8080%{REQUEST_URI}" [P,L] </code>
    <br>
    Load distribution: Catch-all for anything that didn't have a cookie or
    jsessionid thing in the url. "ALL" is just a key from the RewriteMap listed
    below. A random one is chosen and inserted. 
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

Since the server ip is stored in the cookie, apache (using regular expressions)
can pull it out and will internally proxy your request through to the proper
tomcat server.

<p>

That works great for sessions that already exist, but what about for sessions
that don't exist? That's what <code>${SERVERS:ALL}</code> is for. You need
something like this in your frontends.conf file:

<pre>
ALL 192.168.0.10|192.168.0.11
</pre>

This would be even better if you only used DNS for this. Then, you wouldn't
need to update any config files when you added or removed tomcat servers.

<p>

If you had the fallback redirect of:

<pre>
<strike>RewriteRule "^(.*)"       "http://${SERVERS:ALL}:8080%{REQUEST_URI}" [P,L]</strike>
RewriteRule "^(.*)"       "http://mytomcats.foo.com:8080%{REQUEST_URI}" [P,L]
</pre>

Apache should redirect internally to "mytomcats.foo.com" which should result in
a dns lookup of that hostname. If you have multiple records in that hostname,
you get round-robin balancing across all tomcats for new sessions. When you add
or remove tomcat servers, you don't have to update any config files.

<p>
No config files to change when you add new servers? That makes for healthy,
dynamic scaling.

<p>

The best way to solve this would be to have tomcat share it's session data, but
it uses multicast, and the network where tomcat lives doesn't have multicast
routing enabled, so that doesn't seem like an option.
