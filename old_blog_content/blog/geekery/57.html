"version 1" of my mail viewer for mh is done. It currently supports any number
of viewers including w3m, links, lynx, less, more, vi, emacs, joe, and others.
It also will do pgp verification on mail that is signed with a signature attached (Although mail that is simply armored and begin with <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----</code> is NOT supported, <i>yet</i>).<p>
Anyhoo, it supports multipart mail and will display HTML email properly (aswell as html attachments). If you want to try it, click the link on the right.<p>
