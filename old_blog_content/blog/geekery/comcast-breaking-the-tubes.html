I only noticed this now. Perhaps it is old.

% dig +noquestion +nostats +nocmd +nocomments www."I wonder if this query will return".com

Comcast only appears to be stealing dns queries for www.*.&lt;tld&gt;, which is
slightly less annoying than what OpenDNS does, but OpenDNS is opt-in (you have
to point your dns at opendns, where Comcast tells your cable modem what it
should advertise for dns over dhcp).

Sigh.
