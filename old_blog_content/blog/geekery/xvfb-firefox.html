<a href="http://www.ejohn.org">Resig</a> has a bunch of unit tests he does to make sure <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> works properly on whatever browser. Manually running and checking unit test results is annoying and time consuming. Let's automate this.

<p>

<div class="update">
<b> Update (May 2010): </b> See 
<a href="/blog/geekery/headless-wrapper-for-ephemeral-xservers.html">this
post</a> for more details on automating xserver startup without having to worry
about display numbers (:1, :2, etc).
</div>

<p>

Combine something simple like Firefox and Xvfb (X Virtual Frame Buffer), and you've got a simple way to run Firefox without a visible display.

<p>

Let's start Xvfb:

<pre>
startx -- `which Xvfb` :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24

# Or with Xvnc (also headless)
startx -- `which Xvnc` :1 -geometry 1024x768x24

# Or with Xephyr (nested X server, requires X)
startx -- `which Xephyr` :1 -screen 1024x768x24

</pre>


This starts Xvfb running on :1 with a screen size of 1024x768 and 24bits/pixel color depth. Now, let's run firefox:

<pre>
DISPLAY=:1 firefox

# Or, if you run csh or tcsh
env DISPLAY=:1 firefox
</pre>

Seems simple enough. What now? We want to tell firefox to go to google.com, perhaps.

<pre>
DISPLAY=:1 firefox-remote http://www.google.com/
</pre>

Now, let's take a screenshot (requires ImageMagick's import command):

<pre>
DISPLAY=:1 import -window root googledotcom.png
</pre>

Lets see what that looks like: <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/googledotcom.png">googledotcom.png</a>

<p>

While this isn't complicated, we could very easily automate lots of magic using
something like the Selenium extension, all without requiring the use of a
visual display (Monitor). Hopefully I'll find time to work on something cool
using this soon.

<p>

Problems with screen scraping and other website interaction automation is that
it almost always needs to be done without a browser. For instance, all of my
screen scraping adventures have been using Perl. Browsers already know how to
speak to the web, so why reinvent the wheel?

<p>

Firefox has lots of javascript-magic extensions such as <a
href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">greasemonkey</a> and <a
href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> to let you execute
browser-side javascript and activity automatically. Combine these together with
Xvfb, and you can automate lots of things behind the scenes.

<p>

Tie this back to unit tests. Instead of simply displaying results of unit tests,
have the page also report the results to a cgi script on the webserver. This
will let you automatically test websites using a web browser and have it
automatically report the results back to a server.
