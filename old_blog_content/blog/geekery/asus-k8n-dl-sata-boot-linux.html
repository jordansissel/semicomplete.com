So my new fancy computer is here. Turns out I originally bought the wrong
formfactor motherboard, because I had a silly moment.

<p>

Either way, I've now got the system running, but not without some serious battle scars.

<p>

Ubuntu happily installed (very slow to partition/newfs stuff though). However,
upon reboot, the bios clearly couldn't see the boot drive. My SATA drives are
plugged into the on-board Silicon Image RAID controller with no raid
configurations set up.

<p>

Guessing, I told the raid controller to create a 1-disk concatonation with the
disk I wanted to boot from. Voila, the BIOS sees the one disk now and I can
boot from it. Linux finds the other two SATA drives when booting.

<p>

Sigh..

<p>

Also, when Ubuntu says "Computing the new partitions" it really means "I'm
creating a new partition right now. Go get something to eat, I'm going to be
here for a while." Large partitions, for some reason, take quite some time to
create.
