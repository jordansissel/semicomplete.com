Another year later, and much has changed.

<p>

Basic life summary: <a href="/blog/geekery/a-step-in-a-new-direction.html">Left Google</a> for a startup company. Got married. 

<p>

This year was a great year of learning and exploration. The learning started by
evaluating different regular expression systems: from <a
href="/blog/geekery/oniguruma-named-capture-example.html">Oniguruma and C</a>,
to <a href="/blog/geekery/boost-xpressive-testing.html">Boost
and C++</a>, to <a href="/blog/geekery/grok-pcre-sneak.html">PCRE and C</a> -
all in trying to find a non-perl platform for grok.  Learning flex and bison
for grok's config parsing was fun. I also learned how to write C modules for
Ruby and Python. 

<p>

Greater expansion of my X11 knowledge occured in an effort to improve xdotool
and keynav; other X11 work was in toying with the idea of <a
href="/blog/geekery/tsawm-window-manager-project.html">writing my own window
manager</a>. The window manager was never completed, but I learned a great deal
more about how things in X work. I also learned ruby, ruby on rails, more
automation skills and more networking knowledge. Being one to always use the
tool that most easily and appropriately solves a problem, I went into the realm
of Windows. This journey has so far taught me VBScript, PowerShell, WMI,
sysprep, and a host of random windows management tricks.

<p>

My new job brought me exactly what I needed - a fresh pool of things to learn
and problems to solve. Since leaving Google, I never found myself wishing I had
stayed. It doesn't hurt that I haven't had to carry a pager in the past eight
months (something we'll be changing in the future as SLAs will demand it). The
various projects I've been working on at the office are pretty cool, and some
day I may write about them here.

<p>

In consumerland, I signed up for <a
href="/blog/geekery/rhapsody-on-linux.html">Rhapsody</a> and haven't regretted
it. I tried the iTunes store, but <a href="/blog/rants/the-itunes-model.html">I
don't fit iTunes</a>. I love Rhapsody. It would cost me more than $3500 (at
$0.99/song) to replicate my growing Rhapsody library in iTunes, but it's cost
me less than $100 (6 months of service, so far). For Christmas, I got a <a
href="http://go.shopsansa.com/content/fuze">Sansa Fuze</a> which I can use with
Rhapsody (For a $2/mo increase in service to upgrade to 'Rhapsody To Go') and
most any music I want.  Rhapsody is awesome, and iTunes can suck it. As a
bonus, I don't have to deal with any retarded headphone adapters to listen to
music on my iPhone anymore, thanks to my new Sansa Fuze.

<p>

Event happenings this year seemed less frequent than past years. Still, there
were good ones. I did a cool hack at <a
href="/blog/geekery/yahoo-hackday-08.html">Yahoo! Open Hack Day</a> with
Delicious and Yahoo! Pipes. I again helped run the Hack or Halo competition at
Shmoocon 2008, which went smoothly. The annual trip to Vegas for Defcon
occured, too. Lastly, but not leastly, I flew out to Rochester for <a
href="/blog/geekery/barcamp-rochester3.html">BarCamp Rochester 3</a> and hung
out with lots of college friend folk.

<p>

It feels like I coded less this year. Reviewing this year's posts, I see less
significant project work than previous years. Grok got ported to C++, then
<a href="/blog/geekery/grok-pcre-sneak.html">distaste</a> for that lead to
porting it to C. After months of barely hacking on it, the C version finally
got a beta release. Tabsearch, keynav, and xdotool received some love and
attention in the form of updates, features, and bug fixes.

<p>

I started giving up my habit of running things myself (AKA, love the cloud).
One change I made this year was to start using <a
href="/blog/geekery/migration-to-googlecode.html">Google code hosting</a>.
Despite my odd usage (multiple projects under the same name "semicomplete"),
it's been awesome. Publishing and tagging releases is trivial, subversion
change logs are easily viewable, and the source code viewer is easy to read.
There are other features, but I don't use them.

<p>

I also switched from using mh as my mail reader to using google hosted apps.
My familiarity with using gmail at Google made the transition easy. This switch
has let me stop caring about training spam assassin and stop wonderng why so
much spam gets through, because my spam experience with google hosted mail is
much much nicer. Gmail good.

<p>

December was spent writing articles for <a
href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com">sysadvent - a systems administration
advent calendar</a>. Despite the stress of forcing myself to write so much, it
was one of the most valuable things I've done online this year. Sysadvent is
part of a response to my realization that I don't really have any community
ties. I'm a community of one. I work on my own tools and projects. I'd like to
help elsewhere, outside of the office, but nothing has so far attracted me.

<p>

Lastly, some of this year's notable hacks included an attempt at <a
href="/blog/geekery/non-compiler-caching.html">speeding up build systems with
caching</a>, <a
href="/blog/geekery/vim-function-to-make-errors-readable.html">vim function to
make C++ Template error messages readable</a>, and <a href="/blog/tags/screen ninja">a few gnu screen scripts to make life easier</a>. I also keep <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/source/browse/codesamples">sample code in
revision control</a> in an effort to provide sample code to help searching.

<p>

Here's to a fantastic 2009 :)
