With pimp, I need to serve two kinds of requests. The first, is standard web
requests. The second is data streaming requests.

<p>

Pylons serves standard requests like a champ. However, I was finding it hard to
convince controller methods to send data gradually in a stream. Some brief
searching told me that Pylons 0.9.3 supported iterators for data. That is, you
could have a controller yield data (using generators) and each yielded piece
would be logically sent as it is generated.

<p>

However, I was never able to get it to work. I almost gave up when I did yet
another search for answers. This search lead me to <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-discuss/browse_thread/thread/32f4a69cfc4a170f/b7896e3cac1e391a?lnk=gst&q=generator&rnum=1#b7896e3cac1e391a">this
thread</a> which explains the solution. In the project config file
(development.ini, or whatever), you need to disable debug mode before
generators will work properly. 

<p>

If debug mode is enabled, pylons will wait for data to finish sending (through
generators or otherwise) before the data is actually given to the requesting
client.
