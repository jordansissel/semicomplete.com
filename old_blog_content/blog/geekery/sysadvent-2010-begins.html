Today starts the 3rd year of the <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com">SysAdvent calendar</a>! How time flies!

<p>

What is SysAdvent? It's a 24-day event where I publish one excellent sysadmin
article each day, starting December 1st. The articles are written by fellow
sysadmins around the world.

<p>

Planning for this year has been quite a success. Many folks have contributed
finished articles or drafts already and more have committed to writing
about a topic. This is a huge step for the SysAdvent project.

<p>

SysAdvent is for sysadmins, so please share sysadvent with your coworkers,
reddit, digg, twitter, and any other places with sysadmin communities.

<p>

The first article for this year is about <a
href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-1-linux-containers-lxc.html">Linux
Containers (LXC)</a>. Go, read! Add sysadvent to your rss reader, too :)

<p>

Also, there are still 50ish articles from the past two years, all quite good.
Have a look at the <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2008-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&updated-max=2009-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&max-results=25">2008</a> and <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2009-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&updated-max=2010-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&max-results=26">2009</a> years, too!
