Logstash uses EventMachine, which is an event-driven library for Ruby. Part of
logstash's requirements is the ability to watch logfiles like 'tail -f' would.
Previously, I was using File::Tail, but this was not EventMachine friendly.

<P>

Additionally, it's pretty common for applications to write to files with
generated names that include timestamps, etc, so it was clear logstash would
need a way to watch a pattern of files, like a glob such as /var/log/*.log

<p>

Thus was born eventmachine-tail.

<p>

You can install it with:

<pre>
gem install eventmachine-tail
</pre>

And try the 'rtail' tool that comes with it:
<pre>
rtail -x "*.gz" "/var/log/**/*"
</pre>

The project is hosted on github: <a href="http://github.com/jordansissel/eventmachine-tail">jordansissel/eventmachine-tail</a>.

This is the first project I've tried to use git with. I'm not really happy with
git as it only seems to complicate my workflow, but I'll try to stick with it.
