If you're reading this and were at BarCamp San Francisco, I was the guy wearing
pajamas throughout the event. Shoot me an email, let's keep in touch. 

<p>

I'd been meaning to write a general summary of the kinds of technologies
prevalent at this BarCamp, so here it is: The typical "Web 2.0" demos and
discussions were present, aswell as political and legal discussions. Lots of
Drupal fans were also here; I keep hearing more and more about Drupal as time
goes on. This BarCamp seemed to have a greater focus on mobile technology and
microformats.  Unfortunately, I didn't get around to finding time to attend the
mobile technology sessions.  Along with that were a large number of
microformats-oriented sessions, which were cool. A few of the technorati guys
were here and were big pushers of microformats. There was also a great deal of
schwag to be had. I picked up a few T-shirts, a mug, some stickers, etc.

<p>

The last day (sad!) of BarCamp was today. The numbers have dwindled somewhat as
folks went home never to return. I attended a lightning talk on <a
href="http://www.meyerweb.com/s5">S5</a> and a very cool introduction to
Microsoft's Atlas framework. I was hoping to see a whole track dedicated to
lightning talks (aka speed geeking?). I'm sad to go, but I'm bound to go to more
BarCamps after this one, my second barcamp.

<p>

S5 is a simple web-based presentation software. It has features that make me say
"Hey, I want that in my presentation software!" It's standards compliant and
uses microformats. It's a very neat, simple, easy, and new-tech presentation
technology.

<p>

Atlas is the first framework I've been exposed to that incorporates client and
server code generation and interaction. It's cool to see how you can expose C#
functions to websites via ASP and JavaScript. I'm certain other frameworks exist
to do similar things, but I'm not in the market for it so I don't know about
them. Cool presentation.

<p>

I gave my Unix and Vim presentations today, which was sort of the impetus for
the S5 presentation, so that others (including me) could learn about S5 and it's
coolness. My future presentations will likely be using S5, now that it's
matured. I'm told lots of extremely useful features are in testing and should be
released soon. 

<p>

So much for not my worry of not having anything to present on, eh? 6 sessions of
various kinds, and I attended many more. I'm flat-out exhausted, but I can't
stop thinking about the weekend.

<p>

It's more than just the sessions that make BarCamp worth it to me. New
technologies are really cool to see. Everyone like demos, right? My favorite
part about BarCamp is meeting the people. Camps and conferences like BarCamp
create such a useful avenue to talk to fellow geeks, business folk, lawyers, and
whoever else attends. The greater portion of last night was spent talking about
lots of random socio-political geek stuff. Talking to industry and non-industry
people about where they think the mad train of technology is headed. Everyone
seems to be willing to talk to everyone else. That's my kind of town.

<p>

A super mega huge thanks to Microsoft for hosting, all of the great sponsors
(coffee!), and everyone who helped make this event a huge success. Who knows?
Maybe large corporations will see this event at Microsoft's office as a sign
that they, too, can host a BarCamp, or sponsor another BarCamp-style event.

<p>

<a href="http://www.barcamp.org/BarCampEarth">BarCampEarth</a> is coming in 2 months. I haven't
seen anything about a bay area camp for BarCampEarth. Maybe if I find some
time and others to help plan, perhaps we'll have a BarCamp in the area for
BarCampEarth?

<p>

For now, it's back to the Real World. Riding BART back has actually provided me
a great opportunity for writing and reflecting about the event and the weekend.
Double-plus for rapid transit!

<p>

In closing: S5, Atlas, AJAX is still in, microformats, *Camp Network Kit,
social geekery, and beer.
