I added block support to EM::file_tail in the eventmachine-tail gem. This lets
you give a handler to the tail instead of a class, which could mean less code
to write for the common case (handle lines of input):

<pre>
require "rubygems"
require "eventmachine-tail"

def main(args)
  if args.length == 0
    puts "Usage: #{$0} &lt;path&gt; [path2] [...]"
    return 1
  end

  EventMachine.run do
    args.each do |path|
      EventMachine::file_tail(path) <b>do |filetail, line|
        # filetail is the 'EventMachine::FileTail' instance for this file.
        # line is the line read from thefile.
        # this block is invoked for every line read.
        puts line
      end</b>
    end
  end # EventMachine.run
end # def main

exit(main(ARGV))
</pre>

You can use gem to install the latest eventmachine-tail.
