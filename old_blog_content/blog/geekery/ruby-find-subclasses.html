Use the ObjectSpace class to find all ancestors of a given class.

<pre>
class Foo; end
class Bar < Foo; end
class Baz < Foo; end

subclasses = ObjectSpace.each_object(Class).select do |klass|
  klass.ancestors.include?(Foo) and klass != Foo
end

# prints "[Baz, Bar]"
puts subclasses
</pre>

Of course, you could always override Class#inherited instead, but if you don't
want to override methods, the above is a reasonable choice.
