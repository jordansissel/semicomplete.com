I spent this weekend working on implementing <a
href="/blog/geekery/grok-pattern-autodiscovery.html">automatic pattern
discovery</a> in the C version of grok. I updated the C and Ruby API to be able
to use this discovery:

<pre>
% irb -rrubygems -rgrok
&gt;&gt; grok = Grok.new
&gt;&gt; grok.add_patterns_from_file("/usr/local/share/grok/patterns/base")
&gt;&gt; pattern = grok.discover("There's no place like 127.0.0.1")
=&gt; "\\QThere's no place like \\E%{IP}\\Q\\E"
&gt;&gt; grok.compile(pattern)
&gt;&gt; grok.match("There's no place like 24.55.33.55").captures
=&gt; {"IP"=&gt;["24.55.33.55"]}
&gt;&gt; grok.match("There's no place like 234.345.12.4")
=&gt; false
</pre>

This will most likely get used in <a
href="http://logstash.googlecode.com">logstash</a> to provide a helping hand in
building log patterns. It could also be used on events that have no pre-defined
pattern so we can at least attempt to parse the log line.

<p>

On a more important note, this was one of the few remaining features the perl
grok implementation had that the C version did not.

<p>

You can download the latest version of grok 
<a
href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/files/grok-1.20100419.2840.tar.gz">here</a>.
You can also install the ruby grok gem with <code>gem install jls-grok</code>.


<p>

On another project node, I pushed a new <a href="/projects/fex">fex</a> <a
href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/files/fex-1.20100416.2814.tar.gz">release
</a> that includes some small fixes and also an rpm spec.
