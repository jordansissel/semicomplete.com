HAML documentation mentions "partials" twice, in passing only. Doesn't actually
say how to use them, best as I can tell. Lots of the documentation seems
to be heavily Rails-focused (mentions of link_to and other methods). Frankly, if 
I didn't already have lots of Rails experience, I think some of the haml docs
would be pretty confusing.

<p>

In Sinatra, you invoke haml by simply calling 'haml' with your template name.

<pre>
  get "/" do
    haml :index
  end
</pre>

On that note, Sinatra (or HAML, I haven't checked) will let you use layouts,
too, something I found hardly documented. Layouts are a way to basically wrap
your entire template in another template called 'layout.haml' by default
- useful if you want every page to have the same structure. You can also
define different layouts.

<p>

What I wanted was a simple layout with a header in a separate template. Here's
what I did:

<p>

layout.haml:
<pre>
%html
  %head
    %title Hello!
  %body
    #header
      =haml :header, :layout => false
    #content
      =yield
</pre>

Thie 'yield' will invoke the original template called as 'haml :index', helping
keep each page using the same layout. Additionally, I render the header by calling
a separate haml template; calling haml with ':layout => false' tells it to
ignore any layout files. This lets us invoke another haml template.

<p>

Also, since the 'haml' method only takes symbols, if you want to put your haml
templates in different directories, you'll have to use this awkward syntax:

<pre>
  haml :"some/path/to/template"
    #  ^ Note the ':' before the string. You can also probably the
    #  String#to_sym method.
</pre>
