The new C version of grok is ready for beta testing.

<p>

The requirements  are listed in the INSTALL file. There are piles of
differences between the new C version and the old perl version, including
a different config file syntax to let you more easily batch common input sets
through the same set of matches. I'll publish a complete feature list when I
get around to it, which isn't right now.

<p>

The tarball comes with a sample grok.conf that shows you a a few different
things you can do with the new version.

<p>

To run it, once you've built it, you must have a 'grok.conf' in the same
directory from which you are running the 'grok' binary.

<p>

Please send any questions you have to grok-users@googlegroups.com.
