The following tools are awesome: strace, truss, ltrace, dtrace, and systemtap.

<p>

Sometimes I'm trying to debug a ruby library or application, and I end up
monkeypatching things just to see what arguments are being passed as a
away of sanity checking configuration or correctness. Other times
I want to profile the time spent only in a certain class, or method, etc.
At a basic level, I'm looking for a simple ltrace equivalent in ruby.

<p>

Enter <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-minstrel">minstrel</a>.
There may be projects out there already that do this, but I don't know of one,
so it got written tonight.

<p>

You can 'gem install minstrel' to get it (or <a
href="http://rubygems.org/gems/minstrel">here (rubygems)</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-minstrel">here (github)</a>)

<p>

My standard path of debugging (without other options) is to sanity check my
code and then dive into the code for whatever app/library I am using. It often
requires root access to modify ruby libs on the system, which sucks for one-off
debugging. Writing up monkeypatches guessing at methods that I should inspect
is error prone and sucky. Monkeypatching for debugging is common for me and is
about as efficient/productive as using LD_PRELOAD to hack in my own method
calls. (see <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/liboverride">liboverride</a>). It
sucks.

<p>

Minstrel is something better than a bag of the usual hope+monkeypatch+time
combination. For example. Let's use minstrel to debug why mcollective's
'mc-ping' is failing:

<pre>
snack(~) % /usr/sbin/mc-ping
connect failed: Connection refused - connect(2) will retry in 5
</pre>

Ok, connection refused. To what? Yes, I could use strace or tcpdump to debug
this particular issue. But that's not the point, here. After looking at the
mcollective code for a few minutes I came up with a few classes I want to
instrument.

<pre>
snack(~) % % RUBY_INSTRUMENT="MCollective::Connector::Stomp,Stomp::Connection,TCPSocket" minstrel /usr/sbin/mc-ping
Wrap of TCPSocket successful
Wrap of Stomp::Connection successful
Wrap of MCollective::Connector::Stomp successful
enter MCollective::Connector::Stomp#connect([])
enter Stomp::Connection#socket([])
class_enter TCPSocket#open(["localhost", 6163])
class_exit_exception TCPSocket#open(["localhost", 6163])
connect failed: Connection refused - connect(2) will retry in 5
</pre>

Voila.
