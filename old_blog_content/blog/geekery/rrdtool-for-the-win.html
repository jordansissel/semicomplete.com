I need to relearn rrdtool, again, for this sysadmin time machine project.
Today's efforts were spent testing for features I hoped were in RRDTool. So
far, my feature needs are met :)

<p>

Take something simple, like webserver logs. Let's graph the hits.

<p>

Create the RRD:
<pre>
rrdtool create webhits.rrd --start 1128626000 -s 60 \
   DS:hits:GAUGE:120:0:U RRA:AVERAGE:.5:5:600000 \
   RRA:AVERAGE:.5:30:602938 RRA:AVERAGE:.5:60:301469 \
   RRA:AVERAGE:.5:240:75367 RRA:AVERAGE:.5:1440:12561
</pre>

My logs start *way* back in November of last year, so I create the rrd with a
start date of sometime in Novemeber. The step is 60, so it expects data every
minute. I then specify one data type, hits, which is a gaugue (rate), and
ranges from 0 to infinity (U). The rest of the command is RRA's defining how
data is stored. The first one says take 5 samples and average them, and store
600,000 of these samples, at a maximum.

<p>

Now that we have the database, we need a "hits-per-minute" data set. I wrote a
short perl script, <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/scripts/parsehttp">parsehttp</a> that will
read from standard input and calculate hits-per-minute and output rrdtool
update statements. Capture this output and run it through sh:

<pre>
./parsehttp < access.log | sh -x
</pre>

Simple enough. This will calculate hits-per-minute for all times in the logs
and store it in our RRD.

<p>

Now that we have the data, we can graph it. However, since I want to view
trends and compare time periods, I'll need to do something fancier than simple
graphs.

<p>

RRDTool lets you graph multiple data sets on the same graph. So, I want to
graph this week's hits and last week's hits. However, since the data sets are
on different time intervals, I need to shift last week's set forward by one
week. Here's the rrdtool command that graphs it for us, with last week's and
this week's data on the same graph, displayed at the same time period:

<pre>
rrdtool graph webhits.png -s "-1 week" \
   DEF:hits=webhits.rrd:hits:AVERAGE  \
   DEF:lastweek=webhits.rrd:hits:AVERAGE:start="-2 weeks":end="start + 1 week" \
   SHIFT:lastweek:604800 \
   LINE1:lastweek#00FF00:"last week" LINE1:hits#FF0000:"this week"
</pre>

That'll look like line noise if you've never used RRDTool before. I define two
data sets with DEF: hits and lastweek. They both read from the 'hits' data set
in webhits.rrd. One starts at "-1 week" (one week ago, duh) and the other
starts 2 weeks ago and ends last week. I then shift last week's data forward by
7 days (604800 seconds). Lastly, I draw two lines, one for last weeks (green),
  the other for this weeks (red).

<p>

That graph looks like this:
<p>
<img src="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/webhits-1.png">
<p>

That's not really useful, becuase there's so many data points the graph almost
becomes meaningless. This is due to my poor creation of RRAs. We can fix that
by redoing the database, or using the TREND feature.

Change our graph statement to be:
<pre>
rrdtool graph webhits.png -s "-1 week" \
   DEF:hits=webhits.rrd:hits:AVERAGE  \
   DEF:lastweek=webhits.rrd:hits:AVERAGE:start="-2 weeks":end="start + 1 week" \
   SHIFT:lastweek:604800 \
   CDEF:t_hits=hits,86400,TREND CDEF:t_lastweek=lastweek,86400,TREND \
   LINE1:lastweek#CCFFCC:"last week" LINE1:hits#FFCCCC:"this week" \
   LINE1:t_lastweek#00FF00:"last week" LINE1:t_hits#FF0000:"this week"
</pre>

I added only two CDEF statements. They take a data set and "trend" it by one
day (86400 seconds). This creates a sliding average across time. I store these
in new data sets called t_hits and t_lastweek and graph those aswell.

<p>

The new graph looks like this:
<p>
<img src="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/webhits-2.png">
<p>

You'll notice the slide values are chopped off on the left, that's becuase it
doesn't have enough data points at those time periods to make an average.
However, including the raw data makes the graph scale as it did before, making
viewing the trend difference awkward. So, let's fix it by not graphing the raw
data. Just cut out the LINE1:lastweek and LINE1:hits options.

<p>

Fixing the sliding average cutoff, add a title, and a vertical label:
<p>

<pre>
rrdtool graph webhits.png -s "-1 week" \
   -t "Web Server Hits - This week vs Last week" \
   -v "hits/minute" \
   DEF:hits=webhits.rrd:hits:AVERAGE:start="-8 days":end="start + 8 days"  \
   DEF:lastweek=webhits.rrd:hits:AVERAGE:start="-15 days":end="start + 8 days" \
   SHIFT:lastweek:604800 \
   CDEF:t_hits=hits,86400,TREND CDEF:t_lastweek=lastweek,86400,TREND \
   LINE1:t_lastweek#00FF00:"last week" LINE1:t_hits#FF0000:"this week" \
</pre>

The graph is still from one week ago until now, but our data sets used extend
beyond those boundaries, so that sliding averages can be calculated throughout.
The new, final graph, looks like this:

<p>
<img src="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/webhits-3.png">
<p>

Now I can compare this week's hits against last weeks, quickly with a nice
visual. This is what I'm looking for.

<p>

This would become truely useful if we had lots of time periods (days, weeks,
whatever) to look at. Then we could calculate standard deviation, etc. A high
outlier could be marked automatically with a label, giving an instant visual
cue that something is potentially novel. It might be simple to create a sort-of
sliding "standard deviation" curve. I haven't tried that yet.
