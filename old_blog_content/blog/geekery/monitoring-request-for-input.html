I'm working on a new monitoring system because I can't find one that solves
enough of my problems. It's going to be free and have an unrestricted open
source license.

<p>

I could use your help.

<p>

At this stage, the best way you can help is to make sure I get lots of data
about various infrastructure architectures, monitoring needs, reporting needs,
alerting needs.

<p>

If you can, please share with me the following:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> A description (or diagram) of your infrastructure including network, servers, services, storage, etc. </li>
  <li> What you are using now for monitoring (can be any number of tools) 
    <ul>
      <li> Why you like them </li>
      <li> Why you don't like them </li>
      <li> What you'd rather have, if anything </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> What tools are missing that you wish existed? </li>
  <li> Would more documentation on monitoring, in general, help? </li>
  <li> Do you carry a pager? If not, why not? If so, what does it support? (email, sms, html email, mobile web, normal web) </li>
  <li> Would more documentation help?
    <ul>
      <li> Better documentation on how to monitor the things you need to
      monitor, such as best practices, better tool docs, etc? </li>
      <li> Best practices for monitoring various scenarios? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  
Any thoughts, please email me jls-calmon@semicomplete.com - I'll be
collecting this data into my design document, which you can view in
unfinished form, here:
