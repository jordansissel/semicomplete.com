It's very hard to believe that 2006 is gone. What a year!

<p>

Basic life summary: Graduated from RIT and started working for Google.

<p>

This year has been great fun for me. I've had a chance to work on a very wide
range of projects. Some of them were silly, some of them were serious, and some
were useful.

<p>

Taking the silly category by storm was my
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/tags/hackday06">Yahoo! Hack Day '06</a>
demo of
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/presentations/hackday06">TastyDrive</a>.
That same day involved my presentation of
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/keynav">keynav</a>. If you missed
Yahoo!'s event, then you certainly missed the amazing concert Beck put on! My
presentation at this event resulted in a kick-ass <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/wsj-feature.html">article about
me</a> in the Wall Street Journal.

<p>

Runner-up for silly is definitely <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/pam_captcha/">pam_captcha</a>, a PAM
module implementing a text-based captcha system. My favorite captcha was
obviously Dance Dance Authentication which received wide angst at the 
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/sparsa2006.html">2006 SPARSA
security competition</a>.

<p>

However, pam_captcha ended up being useful in that it caused me to study the
behavior of 
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/tags/pam_captcha">brute-force ssh zombies.</a> Good times ;)

<p>

Looking over my last year of posts, I am reminded of many project ideas that I
never worked on. <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/grok">Grok</a>,
my expert-like pattern matching tool, has fallen victim to forgetfulness.
Furthermore, many grok-related projects have fallen to the wayside: <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/222.html">sysadmin secret
sauce</a> and the obvious children <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/eventdb-ideas.html">temporal
(ooh, fancy word!?) data storage</a>, <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/grok-and-eventdb.html">grok and
eventdb marraige</a>, and some neat <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/rrdtool-for-the-win.html">rrdtool
tricks</a>.

<p>

Hacks were a-plenty this year. Not all of them received written notes, but some
of the neater ones are my <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/productivity/wakeup-script.html">wakeup
script</a>, a hack using <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/squid-selenium-dance-party.html">squid
and selenium</a> to allow you to unit-test webpages by injecting functionality
(xss using squid), and a long-forgotten <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/kioskweb/demo/keyboard.html">touch-screen
keyboard in javascript</a>.

<p>

And how can I forget BarCamp? I attended three BarCamp events this year: 
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/tags/barcampnyc">New York</a>,
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/tags/barcampsf">San Francisco</a>, and
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/tags/barcampstanford">Stanford</a>.
Many friends made. These kinds of conferences are absolutely my kind of events.
Signal-to-noise at BarCamp is bliss by comparison to standard computer
conferences.

<p>

This year also brought me a new hat, as a FreeBSD src committer so I can
further my work on the <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/newpsm/">mouse system changes</a>.

<p>

I miss the free time and opportunities granted as a student. I haven't made up
my mind about the "real world" quite yet, but I'm glad there's no homework.

<p>

With that, I say goodbye to 2006. It was a good year. I'm looking forward to 2007!
