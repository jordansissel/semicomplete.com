Most shebang implementations seem to behave contrary to my expectations.

<p>

As an example, prior to today, I would have expected the following script to
output 'debug: true'

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby -d
puts "debug: #{$DEBUG}"
</pre>

Running it, I get this:

<pre>
% ./test.rb
/usr/bin/env: ruby -d: No such file or directory
</pre>

This is because the 'program' executed is '/usr/bin/env' and the first argument
passed is 'ruby -d', exactly as if you had run: /usr/bin/env "ruby -d"

<p>

My expectation was that the above would behave exactly like this:
<pre>
% /usr/bin/env ruby -d test.rb
debug: true
</pre>

It doesn't. The workaround, however, is pretty trivial. It's only <a
href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/codesamples/shebang.c">a few lines
of C</a> to get me a program that works as I want. I call the program
'shebang'. Why is it C and not a script? Because most platforms have a
requirement that the program being executed from the shebang line be a binary,
not another script.

<p>

<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/shebang ruby -d
puts "debug: #{$DEBUG}"
</pre>

Now run the script again, with our new shebang line:
<pre>
% ./test.rb
debug: true
</pre>

Simple and works perfectly.
