My version of gphoto2 doesn't include support for Wendy's digital camera. Googling shows that this camera supports two transfer modes: mass storage and PTP. Mass storage is where the camera shows up as a removable drive. PTP is a protocol developed by Kodak(?) for transferring data from cameras.

<p>

Gphoto2 supports PTP on other Nikon Coolpix cameras, just not the 5200 model. In freebsd, I use usbdevs(8) to show me the usb vendor and product id.

<pre>
% sudo usbdevs -v | grep NIKON
 port 1 addr 2: full speed, power 2 mA, config 1, NIKON DSC E5200(0x0205), NIKON(0x04b0), rev 1.00
</pre>

The vendor id is 0x04b0 and the product is 0x0205. Looking around online finds
the Nikon Coolpix 5400 with a product id of 0x0119. gphoto2 allows you to force
a given usb vendor:product key to be treated as another. Super useful.

<p>

The following will download all media files from the camera, masquerading the 5200 model as 5400.

<pre>
gphoto2 --usbid 0x04b0:0x0206=0x04b0:0x0119 -P
</pre>
