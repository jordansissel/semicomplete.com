I finally picked up some small parts (leds, breadboard, leads, multimeter) from
Fry's to start work on my universal remote project. Yes, I know you can buy
universal remotes. I want to learn more electronics, so why not use this as a
starter project?

<p>

Since my Soekris box is now free of it's router duties, I can use it for this
project. To do this, I'll need two pieces: an infrared receiver, and an
infrared emitter. I bought an infrared emitter led today, and I just need to
buy a receiver online (they're like $2).

<p>

Before getting there, I needed to learn how to drive the GPIO ports on the net4501.

<p>

It was pretty simple to do, nd after hooking up a few wires I had an LED that
blinked after a few hours of reading and hacking. The code itself was trivial
to write, I just had to learn how to talk to the GPIO ports.

<p>

After writing the blinking code, I decided the next step was clearly to add
fading to the LED. This is commonly done with PWM (pulse-width modulation).
Apple made this technique famous with its "breathing" LED lights on the
monitors and laptops when the devices were in sleep mode.

<p>

At any rate, I have successfully written code that makes both the error led and
the PIO5 (GPIO 0) pin "breathe".
