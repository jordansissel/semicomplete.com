These are strictly cpu-bound tests using 'openssl speed'. I didn't compile any
of the openssl binaries here, so it's possible that differences in
compilationcaused the differences in the numbers.

<p>

I've never noticed a performance decrease of the host vs guest systems in
vmware, and here's data confirming my suspecions.

It's interesting that the performance on blowfish were pretty close, but rsa
was wildly different. The freebsd guest outperformed the linux host in signing
by 10%, but fell behind in verification. Solaris peformed abysmally. The
freebsd-guest vs linux-host data tells me that the cpu speed differences
between guest and host environments is probably zero, which is good.

<p>

Again, the compilation options for each openssl binary probably played large
parts in the performance here. I'm not familiar with SunFreeware's compile
options with openssl (the binary I used came from there).

<p>

Either way, the point here was not to compare speeds against different
platforms, but to in some small way compare cpu performance between host and
guest systems. There are too many uncontrolled variables in this experiment to
consider it valid, but it is interesting data and put me on another path to
learn about why they were different.

<p>

My crypto is rusty, but I recall that rsa may need a fair bit of entropy to
pick a big prime.  Maybe solaris' entropy system is slower than freebsd's or
linux's system? This lead me to poke at /dev/random on each system. I wrote <a
href="/files/blogposts/20070917/devrandom-speed.pl">a small perl script</a> to
read from /dev/random as fast as possible.

<pre>
host/linux        82 bytes in 5.01 seconds: 16.383394 bytes/sec
guest/solaris10   57200 bytes in 5.01 seconds: 11410.838461 bytes/sec
guest/freebsd6.2  210333696 bytes in 5.01 seconds: 41947398.850271 bytes/sec
</pre>

I then ran the same test on the host/linux machine while feeding /dev/random on
the host from entropy from the freebsd machine:

<pre>
% ssh jls@teabag 'cat /dev/random' > /dev/random &
% perl devrandom.pl                                  
448 bytes in 5.00 seconds: 89.563136 bytes/sec

# Kill that /dev/random feeder, and now look:
% perl devrandom.pl
61 bytes in 5.01 seconds: 12.185872 bytes/sec
</pre>

When speed is a often a trade-off for security, are FreeBSD's and Solaris's
/dev/random features more insecure than Linux's? Or, is Linux just being dumb?

<p>

Googling finds data indicating that /dev/random on linux will block until
entropy is available, so let's retry with /dev/urandom instead.

<pre>
host/linux        29405184 bytes in 5.01 seconds: 5874687.437817 bytes/sec
guest/solaris10   70579600 bytes in 5.00 seconds: 14121588.405586 bytes/sec
guest/freebsd6.2  208445440 bytes in 5.02 seconds: 41502600.216189 bytes/sec
</pre>

FreeBSD's /dev/urandom is a symlink to /dev/random, so the same throughput
appearing here is expected. FreeBSD's still wins by a landslide. Why? Then
again, maybe that's not a useful question. How often do you 40mb/sec of random
data?

<p>

Back at the rsa question - If solaris' random generator is faster than linux in all cases, then why is 'openssl speed rsa' slower on solaris than linux? Compile time differences? Perhaps it's some other system bottleneck I haven't explored yet.
