Today was amazing, and I'm far too intoxicated (sorry, blame tonight's open-bar party) to provide a sufficient overview and summary! Sorry ;)

<p>

I will say that I have 6 pages of notes to summarize here, which will show up tomorrow, likely. I was disappointed with DemoCamp (a 2 hour segment of
5-minute-long lightning demos) today. Too many poorly presented demos; too many
horribly-marketed applications. Some of the demos were great, others left me clueless as to the product's features or goals. I'll cover more later. For now, sleep.
