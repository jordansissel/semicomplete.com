Using slight variations on the techniques mentioned in <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/tracking-ssh-bots.html">my
previous post</a>, I've got a vmware instance running Fedora 8 that permits any
and all logins. These login sessions are logged with script(1).

<p>

Fedora 8 comes with selinux enabled by default. This means sshd was being
denied permission to execute my special logging shell. The logs in /var/log/audit/ explained why, and audit2allow even tried to help make a new policy entry for me. However, I couldn't figure out (read: be bothered to search for more than 10 minutes) how to install this new policy. In searching, I found out about chcon(1). A simple command fixed my problems:

<pre>
chcon --reference=/bin/sh /bin/sugarshell
</pre>

The symptoms prior to this fix were that I could authenticate, but upon login I
would get a '/bin/sugarshell: Permission Denied' that wasn't logged by sshd.

<p>

There are plenty of honeypot software tools out there, but I really wasn't in the mood for reading piles of probably-out-of-date documentation about how to use them. This hack (getpwnam + pam_permit + logging shell) took only a few minutes.

<p>

As a bonus, I found a feature in Fedora's yum tool that I like about freebsd's packaging system: It's trivial to ask "Where did this file come from?" Doing so made me finally look into how to do it in Ubuntu.

<dl>
  <dt> FreeBSD: pkg_info -W /usr/local/bin/ssh  </dt>
  <dd> /usr/local/bin/ssh was installed by package openssh-portable-4.7.p1,1 </dd>
  <dt> Fedora: yum whatprovides /usr/bin/ssh </dt>
  <dd> openssh-server.x86_64 : The OpenSSH server daemon </dd>

  <dt> Ubuntu: dpkg -S /usr/bin/ssh </dt>
  <dd> openssh-client: /usr/bin/ssh </dd>
</dl>

<p>

Let's see what I catch.
