I have an ultra10 here that was, until today, running Solaris 10 and was my
desktop. Now, I have opted to install FreeBSD on it to see how it runs. I now
have X running happily. Documentation on the specific pieces of information I
wanted was sparse, so here's what I know now:

<p/>
<ul>
<li> If your sparc64 is old and lacks USB, the mouse will show up as a serial
device. The mouse device is the uart device immediately following the keyboard
one:

<pre>
uart0: <SAB 82532 v3.2, channel A> on puc0
uart0: CTS oflow
uart1: <SAB 82532 v3.2, channel B> on puc0
uart1: CTS oflow
uart2: <16550 or compatible> addr 0x14003083f8-0x14003083ff irq 41 on ebus0
uart2: keyboard (1200,n,8,1)
uart3: <16550 or compatible> addr 0x14003062f8-0x14003062ff irq 42 on ebus0
</pre>

Here, uart3 is my mouse.

<br>

This means that /dev/cuau3 is my mouse. So I add this in rc.conf:
<pre>
moused_type="mousesystems"
moused_port="/dev/cuau3"
</pre>

Run /etc/rc.d/moused start, and the mouse works.
</li>

<li>
X needs to be told what keyboard map you are using. I used <i>X -configure</i>
to generate my xorg.conf. A few changes are necessary:

<p/>
I have a Sun type5 keyboard, so, in my xorg.conf:

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
   Identifier  "Keyboard0"
   Driver      "kbd"
   Option  "AutoRepeat" "400 30"
   Option "XkbRules" "sun"
   Option "XkbModel" "type5"
   Option "XkbLayout" "us"
   Option "XkbKeycodes" "sun(type5)"
EndSection
</pre>
</li>
<li>

X needs to be told about the monitor and what proper resolution:
<pre>
Section "Monitor"
        Identifier   "Monitor0"
        VendorName   "Monitor Vendor"
        ModelName    "Monitor Model"
        HorizSync 31.5-110
        VertRefresh 75
EndSection

Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device     "Card0"
        Monitor    "Monitor0"
        DefaultDepth 16
        SubSection "Display"
                Depth     16
                Modes "1024x768"
        EndSubSection
EndSection

</pre>
</li>
</ul>
