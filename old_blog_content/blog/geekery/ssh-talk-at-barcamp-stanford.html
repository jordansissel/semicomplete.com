I got A.D.D. tonight while working on Pimp and decided to Google myself and see
what came up. I do this once very few months. Normally the results aren't
terribly interesting. However, since I'd recently attended a few barcamps, I
noticed that some folks had written about some of the talks I'd given.

<p>

I found a video of my 'firewall bypass/ssh tunnel/encrypt-your-traffic' session
I held at BarCamp Stanford. Thanks to <a
href="http://www.valleygeek.org/blog/">ValleyGeek</a> for posting this. I'm
assuming the author recorded it.

<p>

Towards the end of the talk I start rambling about nat traversal. Hopefully I
got the point across that nat&lt;-&gt;nat traversal isn't easy, and that
tunneling is a way to do it.

Along with that video, I found my <a

entry for 'Fo Shizzle Friday'</a>. I can't remember why I created that.
