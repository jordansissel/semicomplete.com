The latest release is another important step in grok's life. Most
major changes were outside of the code:

<ul>
<li>
FreeBSD users can install grok via ports: sysutils/grok. Thanks to sahil and <a href="http://atarininja.org/">wxs</a> for making this happen.  
</li>
<li>
The project has <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/wiki/Grok">online documentation</a> and also ships with a manpage.
</li>
</ul>

Hop on over to the <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/wiki/Grok">grok project page</a>
and download the new version.
