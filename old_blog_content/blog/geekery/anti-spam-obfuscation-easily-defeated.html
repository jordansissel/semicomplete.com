I see lots of times where people put their mailing addresses as "foo at bar dot
org" in a hopeful effort to keep spammers from scraping your mailing address.
Heck, mail archive systems often have (and are deployed with) options to
obfuscate email addresses systematically, using the same pattern: foo at bar dot com.

<p>

All it does is hurt usability.

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=HRy&q=%22*+at+*+dot+*%22&btnG=Search">Googlng for "* at * dot *"</a> clearly shows lots of matches. It also matches all of the following variants, due to google searches ignoring brackets and such in words:

<ul>
  <li> foo at bar dot com </li>
  <li> foo [at] bar [dot] com </li>
  <li> foo (at) bar (dot) com </li>
  <li> ... etc ... </li>
</ul>

Query, scrape, replace 'at' and 'dot' as desired. I now have 54 million email addresses. What now?

<p>

Seems like this effort only serves to have people fool themselves as well as to
impede usability. It certainly won't protect you from spam. Why is this method used?
