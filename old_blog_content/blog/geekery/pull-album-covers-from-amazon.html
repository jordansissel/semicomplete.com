Amazon provides lots of web services. One of these is it's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/E-Commerce-Service-AWS-home-page/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2/104-9787804-6282359?ie=UTF8&node=12738641&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">E-Commerce API</a> 
which allows you to search it's vast product database (among other things).

<p>

In Pimp, the page for any given listening station shows you the current song
being played. Along with that, I wanted to provide the album cover for the
current track.

<p>

You can leverage Amazon's API to search for a given artist and album eventually
leading you to the picture of the album cover. To this end, I wrote a little
python module that lets you search for an artist and album name combination and
will give you a link to the album cover.

<p>

So, I wrote <a href="/scripts/albumcover.py">albumcover.py</a> as a prototype
to turn an artist and album into a url to the album cover image. It works for
the 20 or so tests I've put through it.
