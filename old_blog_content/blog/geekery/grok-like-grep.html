I added a new filter to grok: strftime. Same format strings as strftime(3)
provides but you need to use & instead of %. Ie; strftime("&D"). This is useful
when combined with parsedate. I also added a new default pattern, APACHELOG,
which will match a standard apache log entry.

<p>

Along with that little addition comes another way cooler addition which lets
you use grok entirely from the command line in a way resembling grep on crack.
For this we needed 2 new command line flags: new flags -m and -r.

<ul>
  <li> -m : specify a match string </li>
  <li> -r : specify a reaction string. Defaults to "%=LINE%" if omitted.  </li>
</ul>

<p>

The reaction string specifies what is printed on a match. There is no support
(yet?) for specifying reactions other than printing out data. If you want a
command to be executed, you could use a clever combination of the shdq filter
and have grok output shell commands. More on that later on.

<p>

The implementation of this is somewhat klunky, but it works. Under the hood,
here's what happens:

<pre>
% grok -m FOO -r BAR
</pre>

grok takes this and generates the following config in memory:

<pre>
  exec "cat" {
    type "all" {
      match = "FOO";
      reaction = { print meta2string("BAR", \$v); };
    };
  };
</pre>

The data source being read from is output from cat, which is just a lame hack
to trick grok into reading a file from stdin. This is really useful. Let's try
a few examples:

<p>

<h4>Grep a file for anything looking like an IP:</h4>

We have a log file with IPs in it. Writing a regex to grab any line with an IP on it is annoying. Let's use grok:

<pre>
% perl grok -m "%IP%" < /var/log/messages | head -5
Feb  7 19:50:52 kenya dhcpd: Forward map from D962WZ71.home to 192.168.10.189 FAILED: Has an A record but no DHCID, not mine.
Feb  7 19:50:52 kenya dhcpd: Forward map from D962WZ71.home to 192.168.10.189 FAILED: Has an A record but no DHCID, not mine.
Feb  7 22:17:16 kenya named[17044]: stopping command channel on 127.0.0.1#953
Feb  7 22:17:18 kenya named[16239]: command channel listening on 127.0.0.1#953
Feb  9 05:11:17 kenya sshd[22002]: error: PAM: authentication error for root from 211.147.17.110
</pre>

At this point, grok is behaving much like grep, but you get all of the easy
matching power of grok.

<h4> Syslog messages with IPs + extra text processing </h4>

How about if we want any syslog message with an IP in it, and we want to know what date and program logged it?

<pre>
% perl grok -m "%SYSLOGBASE% .* %IP%" -r "%SYSLOGDATE|parsedate|strftime('&D')% %PROG% %IP%\n" < /var/log/messages | head -5
02/07/07 dhcpd 192.168.10.189
02/07/07 dhcpd 192.168.10.189
02/07/07 named 127.0.0.1
02/07/07 named 127.0.0.1
02/09/07 sshd 211.147.17.110
</pre>

<h4> Process apache logs </h4>

What about the new APACHELOG pattern? Here's a sample usage of it:

<pre>
% tail -5 access | perl grok -m "%APACHELOG%" -r "%HTTPDATE|parsedate% %QUOTEDSTRING:URL|httpfilter%\n"
1171799519 /blog/geekery/grok-like-grep.html?source=rss20
1171799581 /projects/solaudio
1171799624 /projects/solaudio/
1171799651 /~psionic/seminars/vi/viseminar.html
1171799652 /seminars/vi/viseminar.html
</pre>


<h4> Break a file into parts grouped by IP </h4>

What if you want to find out what IP causes the most log chatter? Use the shdq
filter and have grok output shell commands which you then pipe to /bin/sh.

<pre>
% cat /var/log/messages | perl grok -m '%IP%' -r 'echo "%=LINE|shdq%" >> /tmp/log.%IP%'  | sh
% ls /tmp/log.*
/tmp/log.127.0.0.1              /tmp/log.211.147.17.110
/tmp/log.192.168.0.254          /tmp/log.71.70.243.218
% wc -l /tmp/log.*
       4 /tmp/log.127.0.0.1
       1 /tmp/log.192.168.0.254
      70 /tmp/log.211.147.17.110
       1 /tmp/log.71.70.243.218
</pre>
