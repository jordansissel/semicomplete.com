<a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/">Sysadvent 2008</a> came to a close
tonight as I clicked the publish button.

<p>

I honestly thought I was going to burn out after 4 or 5 days of writing. Somehow I maintained sanity and was able to write 23 of the 25 articles. <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/">Ben Rockwood</a> and
<a href="http://standalone-sysadmin.blogspot.com/">Matt Simmons</a> tossed an
article each my way, which was a great help in letting me relax. Much thanks to
them. I also had help from a few friends who suggested ideas or gave pointers
when I had researcher's block - when I couldn't decide what to research and
write about.

<p>

My wife reminded me every night around 8PM that I should start writing. Without
her helping me remember my goal (an article a day), I probably would've burnt
out or slacked off playing games or coding, so the successful completion of the
first sysadvent is due greatly to her caring for my own projects. &lt;3

<p>

Each article took a varying amount of time. Some took longer to research, some
took longer to write, and some took longer to rewrite. On average, each article
probably took on the range of 2 to 6 hours to complete (research, write,
rewrite). Some probably took longer, but after a few hours I lost track of
time. When I got stuck hard, I would play TF2 and Left 4 Dead for a bit to
distract and help me refocus. I learned that taking breaks is critical for
breaking through walls of unproductivity.

<p>

The whole research-and-fiddle-with-a-tool experience was pretty sweet, except
for the stress of a self-imposed deadline meaning I had to stop researching and
start writing.

<p>

For those that read it, I hope you enjoyed it. If you have comments, please
email me (jls-sa@semicomplete.com).
