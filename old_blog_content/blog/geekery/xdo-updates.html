I've been working furiously on xdo the past few days. Good times :)

<p>

The result so far is as follows:

<ul>
  <li> xdo is now a library, so you can simply call xdo_click(...) and it will
  handle all the hard stuff for you for the case that you want to use this in
  your own code. </li>
  <li> xdotool is the commandline interface to the xdo api.</li>
  <li> navmacro (bad name) is a very small gtk launcher. Basically it's an input box that runs the contents when you hit enter </li>
</ul>

I include a sample script 'ffsp' which is short for 'firefox searchbar paste'.
It works on my system, but obviously on other systems you'll need to tweak it.
The basics are there.

<p>

So right now, I can do this:

<ol>
  <li> Select a piece of text in an xterm </li>
  <li> Activate navmacro and type 'ffsp' and hit enter </li>
  <li> Enjoy the fact that firefox has been told to search for the contents of
  my clipboard </li>
</ol>

'ffsp' is located in my $HOME/bin/ so I execute it like any other shell script
or program.

<p>

Interested in the code?

<p>

Note: navmacro works on my ubuntu and freebsd systems just fine. However,
xdotool crashes at the end when I do free(xdo->charcodes) only on my Ubuntu
system. Uncertain why, I'm way too tired to debug.
