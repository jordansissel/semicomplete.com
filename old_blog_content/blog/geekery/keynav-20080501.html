<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20080501:
  Patches from Mark (20080501)
   * ~/.keynavrc extends defaults rather than replacing them
   * "clear" in ~/.keynavrc resets keybindings
   * comments can appear anywhere on a line

  Patches from Eric (20080501)
   * If the move or size value is greater than 1.0, then assume it is an absolute value.

  Patches from Lukas Mai (20080429)
   * Fixes a few minor bugs
   * Clean up to compile without most warnings when -pendantic and -Wall are enabled.
</pre>
