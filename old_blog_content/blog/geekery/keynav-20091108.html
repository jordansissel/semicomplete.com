Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/keynav">keynav project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20091108:
  - Added xinerama support.
    * Default 'start' will now only be fullscreen on your current xinerama
    display. You can move between screens by using the move-* actions to move
    the current selection outside the border of the current screne.
  - All xdotool commands now return integers so we can forward their return
    status to the user.
  - Actually handle SIGCHLD now so the shell commands get reaped on exit.
</pre>
