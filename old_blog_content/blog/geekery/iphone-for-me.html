I picked up an iphone tonight at the apple store in the mall. Yay new toy. The
setup process was pretty simple. In fact, I feel comfortable stating that this
cellphone purchase was absolutely the most pleasant cellular experience I've had.

<p>

<ol>
  <li> Go to Apple store. </li>
  <li> Say "I want to buy an iPhone" </li>
  <li> Someone hands you a box with an iPhone in it. You pay. </li>
  <li> Go home, plug iPhone into PC. </li>
  <li> Run iTunes. Follow the trivially simple activation steps(*) </li>
  <li> Rejoice now that your iPhone is activated without ever having to deal with morons at the AT&T retailers </li>
</ol>

(*) My desire to keep my current <strike>Cingular</strike> AT&T account was
satisfied. I was presented with the option of transfering my current service to
the new phone. It even set me up with a data plan. Pretty hassle-free.

<p>

Much love to Apple for making me not have to talk to anyone at the AT&T retail stores.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Uploading photos to flickr is the same as my previous phone: emailing photos to flickr </li>
  <li> meebo.com (web2.0fancy instant messenger gateway) happily works on the
  iphone. </li>
  <li> google reader works too </li>
</ul>

Comes standard with a google maps and youtube apps.

Fancy. The first two project ideas that came to mind are a both remote-control
tools. One for a universal remote (basically smash buttons on a webpage tells
an IR emitter to do things) and one to remotely control a PC (mouse, keyboard,
etc). I'm guessing there will be a VNC client for the iphone out very shortly
after the Apple SDK is released, so I'll think about the infrared remote control project.
