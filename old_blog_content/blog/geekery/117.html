Something I'd never bothered doing is reading <code>perldoc DBI</code>. I was looking through it today looking for a function I forgot the name of and I ran across a function, <code>selectall_hashref</code>. This thing is *totally* sweet. It takes a SQL query and a key field as arguments. It then puts all the results into a hash with the "key field" as the hash key. I never knew about this until now. If you're still at a loss for what it saves you, here's what it shortens:
<p>
<pre>
my $db = DBI->connect(...);

my $res = $db->preprae("SELECT * FROM foo");
$res->execute();

my $foo;
while (my $hr = $res->fetchrow_hashref()) {
	$foo->{$hr->{"id"}} = $hr;
}
</pre>
<p>
And using <code>selectall_hashref</code> instead:
<p>
<pre>
my $db = DBI->connect(...);

my $foo = $db->selectall_hashref("SELECT * FROM foo", "id");
</pre>
