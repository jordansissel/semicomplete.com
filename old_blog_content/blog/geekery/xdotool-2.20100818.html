Here's a new xdotool release. This one includes lots of new features and some
bug fixes. All of the tests pass in the test suite (225 tests, 2779 assertions,
173 seconds).

<p>

New commands:
<ul>
  <li> get_desktop_viewport and set_desktop_viewport. Window managers (like
  compiz) use viewports instead of the standard 'virtual desktop' model. This
  means there is usually one big desktop area that you have a small view on,
  and switching desktops means moving that view. </li>
  <li> selectwindow. This command lets you pick a window by clicking on it.
  Useful for chaining to other commands. </li>
  <li> windowreparent. Change which window parents another. Useful if you want
  to move a window  to be inside another. </li>
  <li> windowkill. Kills a window. </li>
  <li> getwindowname. Prints the window name (title). </li>
  <li> behave. Allows you to bind additional xdotool commands to run based on
  certain window events. See the manpage for examples. </li>
</ul>

The changelist from the previously-announced release:

<pre>
2.20100818.*
  - New commands: 'get_desktop_viewport' and 'set_desktop_viewport'. Some
    window managers don't actually do 'multiple desktops' but instead show
    workspaces as views on a large desktop. For example, Compiz Fusion does
    this, which is why you may see 4 or more desktops, but 'xdotool
    get_num_desktops' reports only one.
  - New command: 'selectwindow' command which picks a window by clicking on it.
  - New command: 'windowreparent' with original patch by Markus Opitz.
  - New command: 'windowkill' will kill a window and the client that owns it
    (via XKillClient)
  - New command: 'getwindowname' for printing the name (title) of a window.
    Requested by Dominik Reichl for KeePass.
  - New command: 'behave'. This allows you to run xdotool commands on window
    events. For example, you can achieve 'mouse-follows-focus' with this:
      xdotool search --class xterm behave %@ mouse-enter windowfocus
    This will find all xterms and, upon mouse entering, will focus that window.
    Not really sure what I wanted with this feature, but it can grow as needed.
  - Support percentages in 'windowsize'. Percentages are relative to the size
    of the screen the window is on. 'windowsize 12345 100% 50%' will make the
    window the full width and half height of the screen.
  - When typing, if we can't find a character in the existing keymap, try
    looking up in keysym_charmap (xdo_util.h) and binding a key if we find one
    that matches. Reported by Victor Baulac on the mailing list. This allows
    us to type '@', for example, even if the current keymap does not have
    this key.

2.20100701.*:
  - No functional changes.
  - Add missing file 'Doxyfile' to the release package so the xdo docs can be
    built from a release tarball. (Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
  - Skip 'getwindowfocus' misc test if we don't have a windowmanager due to
    a bug/feature in Xvfb and Xephyr if there is only one client and no wm.
