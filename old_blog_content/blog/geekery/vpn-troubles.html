So, I have a pptp vpn server running in my apartment. I desire this setup:
<blockquote>
I VPN to my apartment. *All* traffic will go through this vpn
</blockquote>

PPP has features to negotiate IP-level information such as DNS and "Here's your
IP" using IPCP. However, it doesn't seem to be able to share routes. However,
my local ppp.conf can say <code>add default HISADDR</code> and suddenly all my
traffic wants to go through the vpn. However, once I do this, I lose all
connectivity to the vpn because it is off-subnet - my machine forgets how to route data to the vpn, oops!

<p>

Is there a way to have ppp add an additional route that I want? Specifically, I
want to take the existing known gateway (say, my wifi gateway) and do:
<code>add [vpnhostname] [currentroute]</code> and then add a default route for
the tunnel. This will allow all traffic to want to go through the tunnel, but
still allow the OS to know how to *get* to that tunnel.

<p>

A hacky solution involves some pre-vpn discovery. I need to figure out what my
default route is. Once I know that, I can simply add a single line in my
ppp.conf and I have all traffic routing through my apartment.

<pre>
 add myvpnhostname mycurrentdefaultroute
 add default HISADDR
</pre>

These two lines create 2 routes. The first keeps the system aware of how to
reach the vpn server. The second ensure a default route to the vpn gateway.

<p>

While this is suboptimal, it is easy to automate. My vpn script can simply
generate a new ppp.conf and grab the default route with:

<pre>
nightfall# netstat -rn -finet | awk '/^default/ { print $2 }'
192.168.55.254
</pre>
