Got a program that can't setuid but needs to listen on a priviledged port? I
was hacking around with Linux's capabilities(7) tonight and came up empty
trying to allow a non-priviledged user to bind to port 80 without having to
start as root - after all, not everything is capable of setuid on startup, like
many java programs.

<p>

Speaking of java, if you do setuid, the java hotspot monitor file thing
(/tmp/hsperfdata_&lt;user&gt;/&lt;pid&gt;) is in the original user's directory,
not the setuid'd user, so you can't jstack reliably. I might be PEBCAKing it,
but this is the behavior I observe. Unless we can fix that, and my java-fu is
weak, we'll have to find a workaround. One workaround is to run a proxy or
firewall redirector that forwards the privileged port to the real port.

<p>

Linux supports this process setting that allows a special non-root process to
listen on privileged ports, but I can't get it working.  I gave up trying to
use libcap's sucap, execcap, and setpcaps tools trying to allow nonroot
processes to bind to lower ports. Let's hack it with LD_PRELOAD and execve(2).

<p>

The trick is creating a socket and binding on the correct port, then sharing
that socket with your process. This comes with two steps, the socket creation,
and sharing.

<p>

The creation is easy, for simplicity, I used ruby. The sharing requires
LD_PRELOAD - we'll override bind(2) and have it dup our existing socket to
whatever socket bind(2) is being called with. The sharing is done using
environment variables to share the file descriptor number and the port number.

<p>

The end result looks like this, where we can now force programs that try to
bind on our specified port to use our pre-created socket instead.

<pre>
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# ./bindandswitch.rb
Usage: bindandswitch.rb [host]:port user group command [arg1 ...]
# ./bindandswitch.rb localhost:80 jls jls nc -l -p 80
setgid: 1000 (jls)
setuid: 1000 (jls)
Exec: ["nc", "-l", "-p", "80"]


# -- now in another terminal --
% lsof -i :80 | grep LISTEN 
 nc        27092  jls    4u  IPv4 8100070       TCP localhost:www (LISTEN)
</pre>

See, now we have given 'nc' the ability to bind to privileged ports as
non-root (user 'jls' above). Sweet!

<p>

The ruby code takes care of creating the socket and doing setuid (I was lazy
and didn't want to write the C code). I also have a very short C library that
simply dup2()'s the original bound socket when bind(2) is called by the new
process on our specific port.

<p>

bind(2) calls for other ports than the one specified in the command line are handled normally. For example, this fails:

<pre>
# ./bindandswitch.rb localhost:33 jls jls nc -l -p 80
setgid: 1000 (jls)
setuid: 1000 (jls)
Exec: ["nc", "-l", "-p", "80"]
Can't grab 0.0.0.0:80 with bind : Permission denied
</pre>

The reason for this investigation was really for seeing how we could allow
non-root java processes to bind to port 80. Maybe I'll use this at work if it
behaves well.
