<pre>
% python example.py "%SYSLOGDATE%" < /var/log/messages | head -1
{'MONTH': 'Mar', '=LINE': 'Mar 23 06:47:03 snack syslogd 1.4.1#21ubuntu3: restart.', '=MATCH': 'Mar 23 06:47:03', 'TIME': '06:47:03', 'SYSLOGDATE': 'Mar 23 06:47:03', 'MONTHDAY': '23'}
</pre>

That's right. I can now use C++Grok from python.

<p>

After I saw it work, I immediately ran a time check against the perl version:

<pre>
% seq 20000 > /tmp/x
% time python example.py "%NUMBER>5000%" < /tmp/x > /tmp/x.python
0.59s user 0.00s system 99% cpu 0.595 total
% time perl grok -m "%NUMBER>5000%" -r "%NUMBER%" < /tmp/x  > /tmp/x.perl
4.86s user 0.94s system 18% cpu 31.647 total
</pre>

The same basic operation is 50x faster in python with c++grok bindings than the
pure perl version. Excellent.

Sample python code:

<pre>
g = pygrok.GrokRegex()
g.add_patterns( &lt;dictionary of patterns&gt; )
g.set_regex("%NUMBER>5000%")
match = g.search("hello there 123 456 7890 pants")
if match:
  print match["NUMBER"]
# prints '7890'
</pre>

I knew I wasn't doing reference counting properly, so to test that I ran the
python code against an input set of 1000000 lines and watched the memory usage,
which clearly showed leaking. I quickly read up on ref counting in Python and
what functions return new or borrowed references. A few keystrokes later my
memory leaks were gone. After that I put python in the test suite and am read
to push a new version of c++grok.

Python Build instructions:
<pre>
% cd pygrok
% python setup.py install

# make sure it's working properly
% python -c 'import pygrok'
</pre>

There is an example and some docs in the pygrok directory.

<p>

Let me know what you think :)
