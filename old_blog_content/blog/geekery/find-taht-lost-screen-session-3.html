<a href="/geekery/find-that-lost-screen-session.html">Previous</a>
<a href="/geekery/find-that-lost-screen-session-2.html">posts</a> about screen
have shown a few new tools for searching your list of open screen sessions.o

<p>

Today, I finally sat down and worked on the next installment: Being able to
query any screen window and the window list. The difference between <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/source/browse/tools/screen-find.sh">
the previous script </a> is that we can now grep screen windows other than the
0th one. Additionally, we can now grep the screen window list (which, by the
way, has some excellent information).

<p>

To that end, I present now two scripts:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/source/browse/tools/screen-session-hardcopy.sh">screen-session-hardcopy.sh</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/source/browse/tools/screen-session-search.sh">screen-session-search.sh</a></li>
</ul>

You need both for this to work optimally, but they exist separately because the
functionality is somewhat distinct.

<p>

The 'hardcopy' script takes a single argument, a screen session. It will
hardcopy all windows in that screen session including the window list. If you
specify OUTDIR in your environment, the screen hardcopies will be put in that
directory; otherwise, the output directory is printed to stdout for consumption
by another script.

<p>

The 'search' script runs the hardcopy script on all active screen sessions (in
parallel, yay xargs). Once it has all of the copies, it will grep through the
output for your query string (regular expression). It supports 3 flags:
<ul>
<li> -t - only search 'window titles' (ie; only window list output) </li>
<li> -w - only search window contents (ie; exclude window list output) </li>
<li> -l - only search the 'location' field of the window list </li>
</ul>

Now, with a single command, I can find out where that ssh session to 'foo'
disappeared to. Here's an example screen window list capture (accessed with
Ctrl+A " (doublequote))

<pre>
Num Name                                                              Location Flags

  0 zsh                                                                        syn $
  1 zsh                                                                      scorn $
</pre>

Now, I want to find all sessions open to 'scorn':
<pre>
% screen-session-search.sh -t 'scorn'
sty 18210.pts-8.snack window 1
sty 18556.pts-0.snack window 0
</pre>

It found 2 sessions. I can attach to the first one with:
<pre>
screen -x 18210.pts-8.snack -p 1
          ^ screen session     ^ window
</pre>

caveat: I've been hacking on things all night, so the code may or may not be
very readable. Apologies if you go blind while trying to read it ;)
