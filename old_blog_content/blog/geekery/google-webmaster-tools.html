Google knows a lot about the web. The <a
href="http://www.google.com/webmasters">webmaster tools</a> allows me to
find out how much google knows about my site, in addition to some other cool
features..

<p>

One of these pieces of data is "what sites are linking to me" which google webmaster tools gives you. It offers this data in a CSV format for offline consumption. I downloaded this, and wanted to see who was linking to me sorted by source url:

<pre>
sed -re 's@([^,]+),([^,]+),(.*$)@\3,\2,\1@' \
| awk '
  $2 ~ /^[0-9],$/ { $2 = "0"$2 } 
  { 
    split($0, a, ","); 
    split($3, b, ","); 
    $3 = b[1]; ref=a[3]; url=a[4]; 
    printf("%s %-130s %s\n", $1" "$2" "$3, ref, url)
  }' \
| sort | sort -k4 | less
</pre>

Yes, the above code could probably be better, but I'm not interested in
elegance: I want data. This lets me get a good overview of who is linking to me
and to what specific url they are linking.
