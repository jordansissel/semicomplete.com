I've been working on a fury of new features and fixes for the now-named Grok
project. I'm almost done adding new features and I figured it was time to make
a release. Head over to 
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/grok">the Grok page</a> and play with
it if you want.

<p>

It is definately production-ready, as far as I can tell. If you use logwatch, swatch, logsentry, or any other log auditing software, then give grok a shot. I guarantee it is better. If it isn't, tell me what you like about the others and I'll add those features.
