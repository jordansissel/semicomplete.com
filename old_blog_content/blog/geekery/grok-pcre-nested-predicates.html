I've spent the past few days refactoring and redesigning some of grok (the C
version). Some of the methodology was using lazy test-driven design (writing
tests in parallel, rather than before), which seemed to help me get the code
working quicker.

<p>

We can now nest predicates, so you could ask to match an ip or host which has a
word in it that matches 'google'. This example is a little silly, but it does
show nested expressions.

<pre>
% echo "www.cnn.com something google.com" \
  | ./main '%{IPORHOST=~/%{WORD=~,google,}/}' IPORHOST
google.com
</pre>

I switched away from using tsearch(3) and over to using in-memory bdb; I've
been happy ever since. Predicates can now live in an external library in
preparation for allowing you to write predicates in a scripting language like
Python or Ruby.

<p>

I'm using CUnit plus a few script hacks to do the testing. It's working pretty
well. I have a few hacks (check svn for these), but the results look like this:

<pre>
% make test
  Test: grok_capture.test.c:test_grok_capture_encode_and_decode ... passed
  Test: grok_capture.test.c:test_grok_capture_encode_and_decode_large ... passed
  Test: grok_capture.test.c:test_grok_capture_get_db ... passed
  Test: grok_capture.test.c:test_grok_capture_get_by_id ... passed
  Test: grok_capture.test.c:test_grok_capture_get_by_name ... passed
  Test: grok_pattern.test.c:test_grok_pattern_add_and_find_work ... passed
...
</pre>
