  Lines of code in my svn repository, by file extension: c 27676, cpp 11488, h 2780, html 1566, java 5496, js 2994, pl 2278, pm 3215, py 2062, sh 1459, xml 8602.

  <p>

  These were generated via 'wc -l' and hence don't ignore comments.  There's a
  few thousand lines of code in there that I didn't author, but I didn't expect
  those numbers to be so high. Crazy.
