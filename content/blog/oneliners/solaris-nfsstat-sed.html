<pre>
nfsstat | sed -ne '/Version 3/,/^$/p'
</pre>

sed++

<p>

When I was bored (at 4 am, no-less), I kept trying to parse this information
out using some crazy tricks with 'x' (swap pattern/hold) and other stuff, but I
forgot the fact that regexps are valid addresses. So, we can print anything
between 'Version 3' and blank lines, anywhere in our output.

<p>

The next thing I want to try with this is to automagically parse nfsstat output
into a format that is more machine readable, this will probably be using awk or
perl, seeing as how doing it with sed may hurt my brain a bit. Furthermore,
trying to read the sed that did said operations would be somewhat intense ;)

<p>

The output looks something like this, on Solaris 9:
<pre>
Version 3: (535958 calls)
null        getattr     setattr     lookup      access      readlink    
0 0%        242223 45%  20606 3%    52504 9%    20025 3%    41 0%       
read        write       create      mkdir       symlink     mknod       
14138 2%    146618 27%  5525 1%     145 0%      337 0%      0 0%        
remove      rmdir       rename      link        readdir     readdirplus 
6279 1%     7 0%        1539 0%     1518 0%     1606 0%     6587 1%     
</pre>

Parsing this would mean generating a tree-like dictionary.
In perl, it may look like:

<pre>
%foo = (
	'Version 3' => {
		null => 0,
		getattr => 242223,
		setattr => 20606,
		lookup => 52504,
		# .... etc ...
		}
	)
</pre>

Should be simple enough, we'll see what happens next time I get bored.
