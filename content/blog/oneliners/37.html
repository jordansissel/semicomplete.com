So I got bored and after discovering that java doesn't let you (Or to my knowledge) access enviroment variables.

<pre>ENVS=`env | sed -e 's/"/\"/g' | sed -e 's/^(.*)=(.*)$/-D1="2"/' | \
      sed -e 's,.$,& \\,' && echo "$*"`
sh -c "java ${ENVS}" </pre>

Put that in a shell script and call it with the same parameters you'd normally call java with. ie;<br>
<code>./lamehack.sh test</code><br>
This will run 'java test' except it also passes a bunch of -D definitions for use in <code>System.getProperty()</code>. For example, you could now do: <code>System.getProperty("DISPLAY")</code> to grab the DISPLAY enviroment variable.
