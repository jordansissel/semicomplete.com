			Download this patch: <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/newpsm/patch-CURRENT-Apr.13.06.newmoused+newpsm">patch-CURRENT-Apr.13.06.newpsm+newpsm</a><p></p>
			Apply the patch (You need /usr/src checked out already):
			<pre>patch -p0 &lt; patch-CURRENT-Apr.13.06.newmoused+newpsm</pre>

			Rebuild world with '-DNEWMOUSE' and recompile your kernel with 'device
			newpsm' and <b>NOT</b> 'device psm'

			<pre>make buildworld -DNEWMOUSE</pre>
<pre>make installworld -DNEWMOUSE</pre>

			Reboot, and you should be good to go. If you have a ps/2 mouse plugged in, you should see:

			<pre>psm0: &lt;(new) PS/2 Mouse&gt; irq 12 on atkbdc0</pre>

			The keyword there is <b>(new)</b>.

			<p></p>

			Assuming everything is OK, you can now try the newmoused. The default
			device is /dev/psm0. The default driver option is to try all modules
			and pick the first one that succeeds.

<h4><a name="id2245001">Configuration File</a></h4>
				You can now configure mice via a config file. Format is the same as
				a termcap file.  Read <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/newpsm/framework.bhtml">
				this page </a> for specific information about the configuration
				file. The config file location is "/etc/moused.conf"
			<h4><a name="id2245016">Progress</a></h4>

<li> start moused(8) manpage - basic commandline options (-p, etc) and reading from newpsm.</li>
<li>moused - configuration via config files </li>
<li>moused - write a synaptics module </li>
<li>moused - write a ps/2 generic pass-through plugin</li>

<li>moused - write a ums (sysymouse?) module </li>
<li>moused - write a plugin interface for loadable userland mouse drivers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="id2245241">Ideas?</a></h4>
			newpsm(4) will only provide a more-or-less raw interface with a
			connected ps/2 mouse. I don't know right now whether or not the X ps/2
			mouse driver will still work, but we'll see. If it doesn't, I'll look
			into having newpsm provide a generic ps/2 interface X will understand
			with an ioctl that lets you switch between generic ps/2 and raw.
			<p></p>
			I'm still trying to get my feet wet with both FreeBSD's kernel and
			talking to hardware, so a lot of my ideas are probably misguided.
			<p></p>
			I recently bought a new keyboard (IBM USB Travel Keyboard with
			UltraNav) which has a synaptics touchpad and trackpoint for mice. The
			trackpoint and touchpad come up as two separate uhid devices . The
			windows driver probably supports lots of things like pressure
			sensitivity, touchpad-scrolling, etc. The protocol may or may not be
			uhid, I don't know.

		<h4><a name="id2245251">Known Issues</a></h4>
<ul>
<li> Microsoft Explorer Mouse 4.0A acts very strangely under ums/moused. </li>
<li> Synaptics USB (on my thinkpad ultranav travel keyboard) seems
				to act funny with moused, though I've only used it for 5 minutes so
				far.</li>
<li> atkdbcreg.h defines PSM_MOUSE_ID, PSM_INTELLI_ID, and others. Shouldn't this be in a more mouse-specific place? </li>
<li> psm needs GIANT, why? More research is required, or someone should just tell me. </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="id2245272">new psm design</a></h4>
			The new psm kernel driver only provides the bare minimum features. All
			of the ioctls have been stripped and replaced with, essentially,
			MOUSE_COMMAND and MOUSE_SET_SYNCBITS. Every other activity has been
			moved to the userland in the form of moused's libps2, a ps/2
			protocol library. Such actions as the old MOUSE_SET_RESOLUTION are
			replaced by libps2/s ps2_set_resolution() which in-turn calls
			MOUSE_COMMAND using an ioctl on /dev/psm0. 
			
			<p></p>
			This moves all of the real work handling the mouse to the userland and
			provides a much more flexible model for implementing mice drivers.
		<h4><a name="id2245280">new moused design</a></h4>
<h4><a name="id2245284">moused: slimmed down</a></h4>
				The new moused(8) will provide a minimum api for the plugin drivers to
				access. The api should provide means to pass state deltas (x, y, and
				other changes) with little else. What kinds of data will a mouse
				driver need to convey? However, deltas may not be the easiest way of
				transmitting button changes from the driver to moused. I'm not sure
				yet. At any rate, the delta will be in the form of passing a structure
				back to moused(8) containing x, y, z1, z2, and button deltas. I'm
				not sure if this should be of the callback form where moused calls
				the plugin for data, or if the plugin loops itself. However, seeing
				as how plugins (drivers) should do the least amount of OS-level
				work, but instead act as liasons between hardware and the OS, I
				think the read loop should go in moused itself. This should be the
				easy part.
			<h4><a name="id2245289">plugin structure</a></h4>
				The plugin structure will work similiarly to how the freebsd kernel
				object system works. Plugins will provide functions to probe for
				mice, read from mice, and reset mice. Probing will be used to
				detection of mice given the mouse type of "auto" to moused. It will
				also be used to make sure the right plugin is used if a user
				specifies what plugin to use. Plugins will be shared objects loaded
				during runtime with dlopen(3).

				<p></p>

				Modules will be provided with protocol libraries to aid in the
				creation of new modules. The ps/2 protocol library has already been
				created and will help developers write new drivers for ps/2 mice.
			<h4><a name="id2245297">filters</a></h4>
				Filters may be a good idea, but their lifespan/usefulness may be
				short, I haven't decided yet. However, the goal behind them is
				something I consider to be a good idea, so moused(8) may provide
				these natively instead of using output filters. The premise behind
				filters would be to manipulate the output of moused before it hits
				the device (and thus, the OS).  Such filters could be to add
				features interpreted from the deltas. For example, a recent patch I
				made to moused(8) added "virtual scrolling" - this could be
				implemented in a filter so that this feature would be accessible
				regardless of the plugin driver.  Another such example is the
				"emulate 3 button mouse" feature provided again by the current
				moused(8) using the <i>-3</i> option.  However, I don't know if
				there are enough delta-reactive features (like virtual scrolling)
				to be written that would merit a filter framework. This requires further
				discussion and brainstorming. A short list of some useful features I can
				come up with are:
				<ul>
<li> Emulate 3 button mouse</li>
<li> Virtual Scrolling (Vertical/Horizontal)</li>
<li> X/Y acceleration</li>
<li> Physical to Logical button mapping </li>
<li> Z-Axis activity (moused -z option) </li>
<li> Jitter correction/smoothing </li>
</ul>

				Many of these have already been written. Check moused/filters.c for what I have done.
