			The old design of mouse magic in FreeBSD appears somewhat ad-hoc.
			psm(4) stands on it's own, as does ums(4), and mse(4). moused(8) can
			be used, optionally. Independently, all three mouse drivers can be
			used as input to X. Without moused(8), you don't get a mouse in the
			console (if you want one). moused(8) can direct multiple mice through
			the sysmouse(4) device, allowing you to present X (or others) with one
			single mouse device. This is great, and allows you to hotplug mice and
			not need to reconfigure or restart X to use it.

			<p></p>

			A problem with this setup is the fact that protocol handlers are all
			over the place. psm(4) supports a number of mice, ums(4) has hacks to
			support different "broken" mice aswell as standard uhid mice. and
			mouse(8) itself supports a number of other mice magic as well.
		  
			<p></p>

			Adding new ps/2 mice drivers to psm(4) requires hacking code in 3 or 4
			different places (if not more) of psm.c. This may not seem all that
			bad, except it is further hindered by the fact that you have to reboot
			every time you want to test your code. Compound that with kernel
			segfaults result in panics, and you have a very difficult environment
			in which to write new mouse drivers.

			<p></p>

			The same goes for ums(4), though uhid is a bit easier to deal with.

			<p></p>
			Furthermore, moused(8) itself is awkward to hack on. Rather, that has
			been my experience. Feature magic such as emulate-3-button is
			intertwined amongst other unrelated logic, making debugging annoying
			and making it annoying to write new features due to the entangled
			nature of the code.

			<p></p>
			I'm not trying to say "this sucks" as an offense to the developers who
			worked on these projects. I simply believe there is a better way to do
			it.
			
			<p></p>

			To summarize, the problems with the old way are:
			<ul>
<li> Protocol magic is handled in many different places </li>
<li> Design is not modular and does not lend itself to easy feature additions </li>
<li> Kernel-land makes for difficult "trial and error" tweaking </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="id45973">The New Hotness</a></h4>
			The new design is based upon a few ideas:
			<ul>
<li> All protocol magic should be handled by moused </li>
<li> Kernel devices should report raw data only </li>
<li> Drivers are implemented in the form of loadable modules </li>
<li> Magic features (ie; emulate 3 buttons) should be modular and independent </li>
</ul>

			I'll address these individually.

			<h4><a name="id45994">Protocol Magic</a></h4>
				Instead of having ums(4) or psm(4) have a deep understanding of
				their respective protocols, they should report data, unmodified,
				from the hardware.

				<p></p>

				That is, instead of psm(4) providing Synaptics Touchpad support, a
				userland driver module should provide this support. psm(4) should
				merely act as a hardware-to-userland interface, and a dumb one at
				that.
			<h4><a name="id46002">Raw Data</a></h4>
<b>psm</b>: The new psm kernel driver should allow protocol
				commands to be transmitted from the userland to the hardware via
				ioctl(2). Such commands include setting packet size, data checksum
				information, and little else. Movement data is transmitted using
				read(2) and will report data of instructed packet size. The packet
				size defaults to 3, the "real" PS/2 protocol's packet size.

				<p></p>
<b>ums</b>: ums simply fronts for uhid(4). Therefore, I believe
				ums(4) should be moved to a userland moused module, which reads
				from uhid(4) devices.

				<p></p>

				No protocol understanding is required for the new psm to function,
				becuase all it does is proxy commands and data between hardware and
				the userland.

			<h4><a name="id46018">Userland driver modules</a></h4>
				Mouse-specific drivers will be implemented in userland loadable
				modules. A module will provide certain functions such as probing
				and data handling.

				<p></p>

				The probe function is responsible for two things:
				<ul>
<li> Test if the mouse is a specific kind of mouse by.. </li>
<li> Enabling extended features of the specified mouse </li>
</ul>

				If the probe succeeds, then we can go about using this module as
				our mouse driver. If it fails, then return failure to indicate that
				this module cannot understand this mouse.

				<p></p>

				The handler function is called whenever new data is available from
				the mouse device. New data is detected using the select(2) system
				call. The handler function is expected to read data from the given
				mouse device and process it as necessary. Updates are conveyed by
				calling an update function with a structure containing the activity
				data.
			<h4><a name="id46037">Magic features AKA filters</a></h4>
				Features such as emulate-3-button, chordmiddle, acceleration,
				button remapping, jitter correction, and virtual scrolling, are all
				what I would consider post-process filters. They are used to modify
				the activity structure after the driver module has processed a new
				piece of activity data.

				<p></p>

				For instance, the button mapping filter would map the reported
				mouse button to another mapping, such as swapping left and right
				mouse button actions. That is, the reports "right mouse button
				held" and this filter would change it to "left mouse button held."
				This is extremely useful.

				<p></p>

				Filters in the old moused(8) are not modular. They are grossly
				intertwined with other unrelated code. In the new moused(8),
				filters are independent functions. As as result, post processing
				filters are chained.

				<p></p>

				This chaining allowed you to have "emulate 3 button" and "virtual
				scroll" enabled at the same time. "emulate 3 button" will send
				faked middle-mouse button activity if both left and right buttons
				are pressed at the same time. "virtual scroll" will change
				movements into scrolling activity while the middle mouse button is
				held. "emulate 3 button" is called before "virtual scroll" is
				called. Therefore, if you have both enabled, you can press
				left and right buttons together, and scroll up and down by moving
				the mouse up and down. This is not possible with the old moused(8)
				implementation.
			<h4><a name="id46117">Per-mouse configuration</a></h4>
				The new moused(8) also provides a means to configure each specific
				mouse. The syntax is that of termcap entries.

				<p></p>

				For example, on my laptop I have the following configuration:

				<pre> synaptics:virtscroll:notouchpad: </pre>

				This enables "virtual scrolling" only for synaptics and disables the
				touchpad. I have a T41 and it has a trackpoint and touchpad, both
				show up via the same psm(4) device.

				<p></p>

				Another example (unimplemented) may look like this, if you have a
				fancy logitech MX100 mouse:

				<pre>usb:type=MX1000:maptokey:9=F5</pre>

				Assuming I do this (might be useful), 'maptokey' would map a button
				press to a keyboard key stroke. Here, mouse button 9 would get
				mapped to "F5" - Keep in mind that I have not implemented this yet.
				More research is required :)
