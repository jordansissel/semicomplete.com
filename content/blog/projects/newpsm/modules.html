/* If you need to use the ps2 library: */
#include &lt;ps2.h&gt;</pre>

			Those should get you started.
		<h4><a name="id45950">The rodent_t Structure</a></h4>
			The rodent_t structure has many members of interest to you:
			<dl>
<dt><code>char *device</code></dt>
<dd> The path of the mouse device </dd>
<dt><code>int mfd</code></dt>
<dd> The file descriptor of the mouse device </dd>
<dt><code>char *packet</code></dt>
<dd> Buffer for storing packets. Dynamically allocated based on rodent_t.mode.packetsize </dd>
<dt><code> int (*update)(struct mouse_info *t) </code></dt>
<dd> Function to call when pushing movement updates </dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id46000">Function Overview</a></h4>
			For every MOUSE_*_FUNC functin, you can expect to be passed a rodent_t
			pointer.

			<p></p>

			The following functions exist:
			<dl>
<dt>MOUSED_INIT_FUNC</dt>
<dd> Used to initialize your mouse module. Perform any necessary configuration and other setup here. Do NOT probe mice. </dd>
<dt> MOUSED_PROBE_FUNC </dt>
<dd> Probe the given mouse for functionality. This function should
				be used to test if the mouse we have opened is somethin we can
				handle.</dd>
<dt> MOUSED_HANDLER_INIT_FUNC </dt>
<dd> Initialization function called before the main loop of moused
				is entered. Do NOT probe mice. This function should be used to
				prepare data structures before the main loop is run. </dd>
<dt> MOUSED_HANDLER_FUNC </dt>
<dd> This is called every time a packet is available for reading
				from the mouse. It is up to you to read data from the mouse. </dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id46039">Initialization</a></h4>
			The init function is declared like this:
			<pre>MOUSED_INIT_FUNC {
	/* Initialization code here */
}</pre>
<h4><a name="id46048">Probe</a></h4>
			This function should test the mouse for features. That is, you should
			test the mouse device (however necessary) to check if it is the kind
			of mouse your module supports.

			<p></p>

			For instance, the synaptics module tests the ps/2 mouse by attemptig
			an extended status request. If this fails or otherwise indicates that
			no synaptics device is present, then it is clearly not a
			synaptics mouse, and we should fail.

			<p></p>

			The following return values are expected:
			<dl>
<dt> MODULE_PROBE_FAIL </dt>
<dd> Indicates that mouse type tests failed, and to not use this module </dd>
<dt> MOUSE_PROBE_SUCCESS </dt>
<dd> Indicate successful mouse probe. This mouse can be handled by this module </dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id46075">Handler Initialization</a></h4>
			Last-minute changes to any data needed before the moused main loop is
			entered. This includes things such as setting expected packet size (In
			ps/2 drivers), enabling magic features such as Absolute mode (for
			synaptics).

			<p></p>

			PS/2 drivers should set the following at this point:
			<ul>
<li> sync mask </li>
<li> packet size (don't forget to update rodent-&gt;mode.packetsize) </li>
<li> ps2_enable_stream(), if necessary </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="id46130">Handler Function</a></h4>
			The handler function is expected to read one "packet" of data per
			function call. That is, only process one piece of mouse activity per
			call.

			<p></p>

			A typical order of operations is:
			<ul>
<li> Read a packet </li>
<li> Check for proper byte length (if necessary) </li>
<li> Parse the packet for mouse data </li>
<li> Set values in a mouse_info_t variable </li>
<li> Call <i>rodent-&gt;update(&amp;(mouse_info_t variable))</i>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="id46161">Summary</a></h4>
			Modules are meant to be simple to write. All you need to care about is
			understanding the raw mouse data and push movement deltas up through
			moused with the update function..
