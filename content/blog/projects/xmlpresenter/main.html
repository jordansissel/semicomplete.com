Some would consider my behavior and preferred operating environment in unix-like
operating systems to classify me as a "power user." Whatever you want to call
it, there only a few graphical programs that I've used that don't make me angry.
Many graphical interfaces place a significant burden on me, the user, through
various means. These burdens include hide-and-seek games looking for a
particular function or feature, heavy mouse usage (which perhaps isn't all that
bad), and generally making me spend more time actually *using* the program than
getting useful work done.

<p>
I'm completely unfamiliar with any and all existing tools to create
PowerPoint-like presentations, so my attempts at making useful work come out of
these programs bring frustration and annoyance. Frankly, I'm a programmer and a
sysadmin; my goal is to increase productivity while decreasing the amount of
superfluous effort I have put towards actually achieving the end result, which
might be a finished PowerPoint-like presentation. Time and energy are wasted on
hunting through a seemingly endless pile of context menus and toolbars.  

<p>
As I mentioned, I am a programmer. I like doing useful work. At the office, I
was told I needed to give a presentation to my co-workers on some various
topics.  In an effort not to have to use PowerPoint or OpenOffice, I decided
that instead of spending time putzing around in either of those programs, I'd
write my own presentation/slideshow solution and use it to write and show my
presentation.

<p>
I'm fairly well-versed in the ways of XML/XSLT and HTML/JavaScript, so I
figured that's where I'd start. The end result allows me to very simply and
quickly throw together presentations on anything I want.  

<p>
As for the technical aspects of the project: it makes use of XSLT to turn my
own "XPL" files into web-based PowerPoint-like slideshows. The xml formatting
of the project is very simple. Slide bodies can contain any HTML I choose to
use for formatting.

<pre>
&lt;slideshow>
	&lt;title> Simple Slideshow Example &lt;/title>
	
	&lt;slide>
		&lt;title> My First Slide &lt;/title>
		&lt;body>
			The body can contain any valid html. It's pretty much copied verbatim using 'xsl:copy' and recursion.
		&lt;/body>
	&lt;/slide>

	&lt;slide>
		&lt;title> This is another slide &lt;/title>
		&lt;body>
			&lt;h3> Example use &lt;/h3> &lt;i> of &lt;/i> &lt;b> html&lt;/b> in this tool.&lt;p/>

			&lt;ul>
			&lt;li> point 1 &lt;/li>
			&lt;li> point 2 &lt;/li>
			&lt;/ul>

		&lt;/body>
	&lt;/slide>
&lt;/slideshow>
</pre>

<p>
That's the gist of it. Slides are displayed in order of appearance in the XPL file. 
This solution solves many issues:
</p>
<ul>
<li> No cumbersome graphical interface </li>
<li> No learning curve (for me anyway, I wrote it!) </li>
<li> Uses programs I'm already familiar with: Firefox, vi, xsltproc. </li>
<li> Doesn't make me angry </li>
</ul>

Browser Support List:
<ul>
<li> Mozilla Family: 100% works </li>
<li> Konqueror 3.4.0: 100% works </li> 
<li> Opera 8: Everything works except browser back/forward (history) </li>
<li> Internet Explorer 5: Navigation works kind of works, something's busted. </li>
<li> Safari: Basic features work. Browser history, side-bar, etc do not. </li>
</ul>
