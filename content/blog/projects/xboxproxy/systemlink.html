    All traffic from the xbox comes from IP 0.0.0.1. The general idea is that I
    take the entire layer2 (ethernet) packet and send it in an UDP packet to
    another proxy. That proxy receives it and dumps it, unchanged, on the
    remote network. That's it. That's the whole deal.

    <p></p>

    Let me reiterate. It doesn't matter what happens above the UDP layer. You
    don't care. The proxy just forwards the raw packets, and your xbox gets
    them unchanged. Works like a charm and is game agnostic.

    This works through the magic of switches learning mac addresses. Your local
    network starts to learn that all of the remote xboxes are coming from your
    machine. The xboxproxy itself also tries to be a bit smarter. It learns
    which mac addresses (xboxes) are coming from what proxies and only sends
    unicast packets to the correct proxy housing that xbox.

    <p></p>

    That's pretty much all of the proxy. It could be done in much fewer lines
    in Java or Python (Scapy for example) becuase 70% of the code is just
    setting up and managing the list of known proxies and xboxes as well as
    fancy packet checking. I'm reasonably certain that if you were to implement
    my xboxproxy in scapy, it would be around 20 lines of code if not less.
