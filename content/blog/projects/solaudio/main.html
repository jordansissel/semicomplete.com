<p>
I hate <code>sdtaudiocontrol</code>, so I wrote a command-line utility to allow
me to control the volume levels. It was easy enough thanks to Sun's excellent
documentation on their audio(7I) interface.

<p>
Compile it with your favorite compiler:
<pre>
cc -o mixer solaudio.c
</pre>

And voila, you have a command-line mixer utility for Solaris SPARC.
