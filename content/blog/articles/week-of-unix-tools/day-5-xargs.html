      <ul>
<li> Use xargs as a 'threadpool' for parallel processing of input. </li>
<li> Take a list of things on input, and run a command with one thing
        as the argument, for all things input. </li>
<li> Reformat word lists. </li>

<h4><a name="id2255983">And then... ?</a></h4>
      No "and then".
    <h4><a name="id2255984">Usage</a></h4>
<pre>xargs [flags] [command [args]]</pre>

      'command' is optional. If unspecified, it defaults to '/bin/echo' or
      something very similar.
    <h4><a name="id2255985">Flags that matter</a></h4>
<dl>
<dt> -t </dt>
<dd> trace. Show the commands being run before they are executed </dd>
<dt> -P{N} </dt>
<dd> Specify number (where {N} is) of forked processes for parallelism; ie, -P5 for 5 processes. </dd>
<dt> -n{N} </dt>
<dd> Call the command with {N} arguments </dd>
<dt> -I{REPLSTR} </dt>
<dd> Specify that '{REPLSTR}' will be replaced with the argument </dd>

<h4><a name="id2255986">First example</a></h4>
      Find some files and delete them.

      <pre>
% mkdir i; touch i/a.png i/b.png i/c.png i/otherfile
% find ./i/ -name '*.png' | xargs
./i/a.png ./i/b.png ./i/c.png

# Default action above was to echo, so it output as if you had typed:
# echo ./i/a.png ./i/b.png ./i/c.png

# Actually delete the png files:
% find ./i/ -name '*.png' | xargs rm
% ls ./i
otherfile
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2255988">Advanced xargs</a></h4>
      Sometimes the "thing" you want to do with this argument list is not just
      one command. You know how express what you need in shell, but you don't
      know how to get xargs to play nice? Not to fear. Simply use "sh" as your
      command, like this example:

      <p></p>

      Rename *.foo -&gt; *.bar
      <pre>
% touch a.foo b.foo c.foo
% ls *.foo | xargs -n1 -I@ sh -c 'x="@"; mv $x ${x%.foo}.bar'
# ${x%.foo} means remove '.foo' from the end of $x. 

% ls *.bar
a.bar   b.bar   c.bar
</pre>

      This example shows using replacement with the character '@'. This means
      any instance of '@' in the command string will be replaced with the
      current value (a.foo, for example).

      <p></p>

      A better example is this, using sh's natural argument handling:
      <pre>
# A quick refresher for you:
% sh -c 'echo $0,$1,$2,$3' hello one two three
hello,one,two,three

# Now let's use it:
% ls *.foo | xargs -n1 sh -c 'mv $1 ${1%.foo}.bar' -
# the '-' is to pass '-' as $0 to sh, so we can use $* and $@ like normal if we wanted.
% ls
a.bar   b.bar   c.bar
</pre>
      
      This lets you use $@, $*, and $1, etc, and is more natural to shell scripting.
    <h4><a name="id2255990">Parallel ssh'ing</a></h4>
      This example expects 'somehosts' to a line-delimited list of hosts to
      connect to. Please note that I am using ssh keys (with ssh-agent) so ssh
      will not prompt for a password when logging in.

      <pre>
% echo kenya scorn | tr ' ' '\n' &gt; /tmp/somehosts
% cat /tmp/somehosts \
  | xargs -P10 -I"HOST" -n1 ssh HOST uptime
 1:28AM  up 11 days,  3:44, 4 users, load averages: 0.13, 0.08, 0.02
 4:28AM  up 2 days, 18:54, 10 users, load averages: 0.10, 0.05, 0.05
</pre>

      There's a slight problem with the above invocation. You don't know what
      host is outputting what data! This becomes much more clear of a problem
      when you aren't executing 'uptime' but instead are doing something that
      outputs many lines.

      <p></p>

      An easy solution is to use sed (or awk, et al) to prefix everything with the hostname.

      <pre>
% cat /tmp/somehosts \
  | xargs -P10 -I"HOST" -n1 sh -c 'ssh HOST uptime | sed -e "s/^/HOST: /"'
kenya:  1:36AM  up 11 days,  3:52, 4 users, load averages: 0.07, 0.07, 0.03
scorn:  4:36AM  up 2 days, 19:03, 10 users, load averages: 0.01, 0.02, 0.02
</pre>
