      <p></p>

      A record is generally a whole line. The default input record separator
      (RS) is a newline. You can change this at any time.

      <p></p>

      A field is generally a word split by any number of whitespace (tab or
      space). The default input field separator (FS) is a single space. FS can
      be a single character or a regular expression. If FS is a single space,
      it is treated magically as if you had specified [ \t]+.
    <h4><a name="id2255986">Field selection</a></h4>
      Fields are accessed using the $ "operator". The following are valid:

      <dl>
<dt> $1, $2, $3 ... </dt>
<dd>(first, second and third fields) </dd>
<dt>  $NF </dt>
<dd> The last field. Nothing special. NF is a variable holding the
        total number of fields in the current record, therefore $NF would be
        the last field </dd>
<dt> x=1; $(x + 3) </dt>
<dd> The 4th field. $(x + 3) == $(1 + 3) == $4 </dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id2255988">Patterns and functions</a></h4>
      Awk expressions come in two forms, a function or a pattern. I've never bothered writing functions.

      <p></p>

      Here's what a pattern looks like:
      [condition_expressions] { [action_expressions] }

      <p></p>

      Basically this equates to the folloing psuedocode:
      if (condition_expressions) { action_expressions }

      <p></p>

      If no action_expression is defined, the default is 'print' which means
      'print $0' which means printthe current record. If no condition is given,
      the default is to execute the action for all records.

    <h4><a name="id2255989">Magic patterns: BEGIN and END</a></h4>
      BEGIN and END are magic "conditions". BEGIN is used to execute things
      before the first record has been parsed, and END is obviously to do
      things after the last record. These patterns cannot be combined with
      others.
    <h4><a name="id2255990">Sample pattern expressions</a></h4>
<dl>
<dt> length($0) &gt; 72 (From FreeBSD's awk manpage) </dt>
<dd> Print lines longer than 72 characters </dd>
<dt> $1 ~ /foo/ { print $2 } </dt>
<dd> Print the 2nd field of all records where the first field matches /foo/ </dd>
<dt> $5 &gt; 0 </dt>
<dd> Print all records where the 5th field is greater than 0. (Complete with magical number conversion, when possible. </dd>
<dt> int($5) &gt; 0 </dt>
<dd> Same as above, but force $5 to int before comparing </dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id2255992">Variables</a></h4>
      Variables are the same syntax as in C. You do not declare variables.

      <p></p>
      Examples:

      <dl>
<dt> $2 == "test" { x++ }; END { print x } </dt>
<dd> Total records where $2 == "test" </dd>
<dt> { $1 = ""; print } </dt>
<dd> Delete the first field of every record, print the new record </dd>
<dt> { $3 = "Hello"; print } </dt>
<dd> Should be obvious. This one is *super* useful; modifying fields inline is awesome </dd>
<dt></dt>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id2255994">Arrays</a></h4>
      Arrays are magical. You simply start using a variable as an array, and it
      becomes an array. Arrays are more like dictionaries/hash
      tables/associative arrays than "real" arrays. Quite useful.

      <p></p>

      Example: awk '{ a[$1]++ } END { for (i in a) { print i, a[i] } }'
    <h4><a name="id2255995">String concatonation</a></h4>
      String appending is simple.

      <pre>
x = "foo"; x = x"test";    # x == "footest"

print $1","$2" = "$3;      # if input was "hello there world"
                           # output will be: "hello,there = world"
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2255997">Example: Open files by user</a></h4>

      This example is basically "add things up by a given key, then print them
      at the end". I use it so often I'm probably just going to write an alias
      for it in my shell.

      <pre>
% fstat | sed -e 1d \
  | awk '{a[$1]++} END { for (i in a) { print i, a[i] } }' \
  | sort -nk2
smmsp 8
_dhcp 11
www 45
root 328
jls 482
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2255998">Example: Datestamp input</a></h4>
      This particular example is *extremely* useful for long-running programs
      that output logs or other data without any kind of timestamp. 
      <b> This requires GNU awk. </b><pre>
% (echo hello; sleep 5; echo world) \
  | awk '{ print strftime("%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S", systime()), $0 }'
2007/05/22 01:09:47 hello
2007/05/22 01:09:52 world
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2255998">Example: show non-empty files</a></h4>
<pre>
% ls -l | awk '$5 &gt; 0'
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2255999">Example: Date-scan your logs</a></h4>
      Let's assume all log entries are syslog format:
      <pre>May 22 01:12:02 nightfall pptp[860]: anon log ...</pre>

      Show only log entries between May 10th and May 20th (inclusive)
      <pre>
% cat *.log | awk '$1 == "May" &amp;&amp; ($2 &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; $2 &lt;= 20)'
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2256000">Example: Scrape host(1) output</a></h4>
<pre>
% host www.google.com | awk '/has address/ { print $4 }'
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2256001">Example: Find an environment variable</a></h4>
      I often login to my workstation remotely and want to use its ssh-agent.
      So, I need to find the most common value for SSH_AUTH_SOCK on all
      processes.

      <pre>
% ps aexww \
  | awk '{ for (i = 0; i &lt; NF; i++) { if ($i ~ /^SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/) { print $i } } }' \
  | sort | uniq -c
  24 SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-sc4iKR7ZIf/agent.721
</pre>
<h4><a name="id2256002">Teeth that will bite you</a></h4>
      Awk falls to the same problem C does. You can assign in conditions. Here's how you screw up:

      <pre>
% cat *.log | awk '$1 = "May"'
</pre>
      This will replace the first field with "May" for every record, and since
      "May" is a positive value, it will print your modified $0 with $1 set to
      "May" now. Ouch.
    </div>
