      There are 3 different ways to cut. One by bytes, one by characters, and one by fields.

      <p></p>

      A range is one or more sequences, separated by commas. A sequence can be
      any of the following:
      <ul>
<li> N = Select only the Nth piece (on each line) </li>
<li> N- = Select the Nth piece through end-of-line </li>
<li> N-M = Select the Nth through Mth pieces </li>
<li> -M = Select the first through Mth pieces </li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>field cutting - get me the 1st and 3rd fields delimited by comma</dt>

one,three

# output space-delimited from comma-separated input (GNU only)
% echo "one,two,three,four" | cut -d"," -f 1,3 --output-delimiter=" "
one three

<h4><a name="id4734">When to use cut</a></h4>
      Cut provides features easily done in sed and awk. Why would you use it instead of sed or awk?

      <p></p>

      Simplicity of statement.

      <p></p>

      Example: Let's print the 1st and 7th fields from /etc/passwd:
      <pre>
% grep '^root' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1,7
root:/bin/sh
</pre>

      In the above invocation, it is very clear to the reader that you want the
      1st and 7th field. Yes, this in awk would also be simple, but if you
      don't know awk syntax, then awk might be harder for you to write and/or
      read.

      <p></p>

      Use the tool that best allows you concisely and unobfuscatingly describe
      what you want to do. Cut often lets you do that. However, there are a few
      cut-like things that you can't do in cut because of the way it determines
      fields.
    <h4><a name="id4765">When not to use cut</a></h4>
      If your input will have multiple instances of the delimiter in a row, cut
      won't do it the way you might think: delimiters are single characters in
      cut. Multiple delimiters in a row are not handled in any special way as
      awk handles whitespace. Consider this simple example:
      <pre>
% echo "one    two     three" | cut -d' ' -f 2

% echo "one    two     three" | awk '{print $2}'
two
</pre>
      According to cut, field 2 in the above example is an empty string because
      it occurs between the first and second space (delimiter). Not what we
      wanted. Keep this behavior in mind.
    <h4><a name="id4777">What is paste?</a></h4>
      Think of it as a horizontal version of cat(1). It will join lines by delimiters from different file inputs.
    <h4><a name="id4793">Basic paste(1) usage</a></h4>
<pre> paste [-s] [-d delimiter_list] [input1 input2 input3 ...] </pre>

      Paste reads a line from each input, in order, and prints them without
      newlines. After one line has been read from each input, a newline is
      printed. Optional '-d' will let you specify a list of delimiters that are
      to be used to separate each input file. The default is separation with
      tab characters.

      <p></p>

      '-s' is a neat little flag, that supresses newline output entirely. The
      effect is that all lines of all inputs are concatonated on one single
      line of output. Very similar to "tr '\n' '*delimiter*'" except there's no
      trailing delimiter. Useful!

      <p></p>

      The same input file can be specified multiple times, which gives you some neat effects.
    <h4><a name="id4820">Why is it useful?</a></h4>
      I rarely use paste, but what it does is quite useful.

      <dl>
<dt> Join input lines in triplets </dt>
<dd><pre>
% seq 9 | paste - - -
1       2       3
4       5       6
7       8       9
</pre></dd>
<dt> Print line numbers </dt>
<dd><pre>
% FILE="/etc/hosts"
% seq `wc -l &lt; $FILE` | paste - $FILE | head -3
1       # /etc/hosts
2       #
3       # This file describes a number of hostname-to-address
</pre></dd>
<dt> List of users on a system </dt>
<dd><pre>
% cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | paste -d, -s -
root,bin,daemon,adm,lp,sync,shutdown,halt,mail,news,uucp,operator
</pre></dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="id4862">Conclusion</a></h4>
      Cut and paste are somewhat niche tools, but keep them in your toolbelt
      because of the functionality they provide. Sometimes it's much simpler to
      use cut or paste instead of another tool.
