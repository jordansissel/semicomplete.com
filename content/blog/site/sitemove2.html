Spent lots of time today updating content, fixing links, etc. I rewrote most of
my <a href="/about/">about</a> section, seeing as how I haven't done so in a
very long time. 

<p>
I'm starting to really like the new layout I've made. It feels a bit more
relaxed and less rigid than the old layout.

<p>

I also spent a few hours of boredom playing in Gimp making a cute, running, stick man
icon to go with my "halfway to the finish line" tag line. As I've said <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/articles/efficiency/#id46245">before</a>,
attempting to do precision mouse movement with a mouse nipple (trackpoint) is
very taxing.

<p>

There's still lots of content (100+ posts, and other stuff) that needs to be
updated to fix links and other issues. I'm hoping to have everything done by
the end of the weekend.
