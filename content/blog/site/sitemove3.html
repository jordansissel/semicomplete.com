I woke up at 1am and my body decided it was time to be awake. So, it's now
almost 5am. From what I can tell, I'm finished moving data and fixing problem
with the projects and articles sections.

<p>

The only changes left are to update the older entries with link and formatting fixes. Whew! Good thing there's only 150+ entries to look at. &lt;/sarcasm>

<p>

I may write a quick wrapper using mod_(perl|python|whocares) around pyblosxom
to do page caching. There's no sense in regenerating a page (running python,
reading files, etc) every time a page hit occurs. There are caching abilities
in pyblosxom itself, but neither cache method (pickle or shelve) actually made
page loads faster in testing.

<p>

If you have comments about the new site, let me know.
