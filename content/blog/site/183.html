Long story short: I found a security-hole type thing in some of RIT's servers.
I contacted ITS (RIT's systems and network team) about the problem. I heard
from the grapevine that they wouldn't fix it, despite the easy fix, so as a way
of venting anger towards sysadmins who respond negatively when you report a
problem, I wrote this article. It explains why setting my shell to
<i>/bin/false</i> is not preventing me from using ssh on your machine.
