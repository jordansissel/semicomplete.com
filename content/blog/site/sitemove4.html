Thanks to my <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/pyblosxom-mdate-vim-hack.html">handy
vim-pybloxsom hack</a>, I took time today to go back through all entries I had
marked broken during the move from my old site to here.

Those entries should now be good now with fixed links, etc. Ahh, sweet productivity.
