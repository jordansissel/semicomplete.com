I've still been swamped with work, life, more work and more life. As as result,
I've posted much less frequently lately than I have in the past.

<p>

This is mostly due to lacking time to spend on research. I've learned many new
things in recent weeks that I'm eager to post about, but I haven't had time to
sit down and actually write.

<p>

So. This site has very few regular visitors, but to those of you who do read:
What should I post about next? Ideas would be much appreciated. :)

<p>

I'm also working on a new site layout and planning on putting more time and
effort into research and posts here. We'll see how far that actually goes,
though. Site layout should be done soon. My awesome (?) GIMP-fu created a <a

Thoughts and suggestions welcome.
