I always do silly things when I get bored. This time I decided that rather than
manually tell mySQL that I want to insert a new news entry, i wrote a shell
script that'll prompt me for everything.
<p>

It opens VIM with a simple template, I save and quit, and it posts. I've got
support to delete the most recent entry and i'm going to add support for
editing entries. Yes, I'm a very sad person.
