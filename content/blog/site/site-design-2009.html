I updated some of this site's design. The most obvious changes are cosmetic
(new banner logo at the top, slight color/layout differences). The least
obvious change (hopefully) is that this site is now layed out purely with CSS,
not tables.

<p>

After refreshing my rotting CSS braincells, I got a layout working properly and
was quite happy. Then I tested in IE, and saw my &lt;pre&gt; tags being
displayed incorrectly (according to my desire, not necessarily the code, which
don't always align):

<p>

The above should have been two lines of text with a horizontal scroll bar. I
want to say use scroll-bar for text that's too wide but expand vertically
without a scroll bar: Never a vertical scroll bar, only ever a horizontal one.

<p>

I've spent a bit today scouring the web with not much help. I've randomly
permuted css values for overflow, overflow-x, overflow-y, min-height, etc.
Having failed that, I read everything I could find from randomly permuted
search queries, one of which lead me to a depressingly long detail <a
href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/expandingboxbug.html">about
IE6's expanding box problems</a>. The page claims (and several others do, also)
that IE7 fixes several box expansion problems.

<p>

I created a very small demo with minimal CSS to show the problem here: <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/files/blogposts/20090105/pre-overflow.html">
Click here to view the demo</a>. It includes the solution I found, detailed
below.

<p>

After some other random permutation, I gave up and tried wrapping the pre in a
div and applying the overflow properties to the div. It worked. It's 2009 and I
still have to deal with weird and obscure browser rendering inconsistencies. I came up with this:

<pre>&lt;style&gt;
  .scroll-wide {
    height: auto;
    overflow-x: auto;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    max-width: 500px;
  }

  /* On firefox, pre tags have a top and bottom margin > 0, which makes your 
   * scrolling div have a blank top line, which isn't what
   * we want. Fix one weirdness to find another? I didn't fully investigate.
   * Here's the fix: */
  div pre {
    margin-top: 0;
    margin-bottom: auto;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

...

&lt;div class="scroll-wide"&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;
    stuff
  &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>

Solving this with wrap-pre-in-a-div can be automated with jQuery and a CSS
definition:
<pre>
// javascript
$("pre").wrap("&lt;div class='pre-wrap'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");

// In CSS
div.pre-wrap {
  /* overflow/height/whatever options */
}
</pre>

It's still possible I was doing something wrong and that this hack isn't
necessary, but I don't know. I'm just glad to have it working now.

<p>

PS: If you use Meyer's reset.css, you'll want to include <code> pre {
margin-bottom: auto; } </code>, or IE will again clip the bottom of the pre
contents with the scrollbar.
