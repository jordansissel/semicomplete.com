Rewrote the online file browser from scratch and I think it turned out pretty well. I stole the icon set from KDE3. It will display directory contents and will output files normally. The browser supports two view modes (icons and list) and two sort methods (by name and by type). It'll display varying file statistics depending on what kind of file it is if you are in icon mode. Screenshot on the right, or <a href="/~psionic/mason/browse">go there now</a>
