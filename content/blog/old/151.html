So I posted some time ago about moving to XML and such for this website. Well
it turns out the apache+mod_perl+libxml setup we have here at CSH is busted
nicely. Apache segfaults when you try to use XML::Xpath or XML::XSLT. I made
several efforts to get a new apache+php+mod_perl+xml working, but it seems
I made the problem worse. The supposed solution is to build mod_perl static
into Apache, which is what I did. Now, in testing, I managed to cause this
Solaris 9 server to kernel panic. Neat! So I gave up on xml for now. <p>

Back to mason with me! The new site is coming along well and has features
I've wanted in my website for ages. Firstly, it's completely modular. My
reasons for using mason for this site in the first place was modularity.
The current website's code is a terrible bit of ugly. The new code is
very very clean and lets me do newer neater things. Secondly, I now make
heavy use of CSS to make the site look the way it does. Again, the old
site is a bag of hackery from the days of HTML 2.0 where we didn't have 
nice things like CSS and such. Look at the source yourself - it's
all embedded tables and ugliness abounds.<p>

The new site can be previewed, for now, at<p>

Mason seems to be having everything I need, again. If you go to the new site you'll
see a "Recent CVS Commits" section on the right. This is generated from a cvs module 
I wrote. It calls things like 'cvs history' and whatnot, and certainly doesn't need to
be run every time someone hits the page. So I use HTML::Mason's awesome caching feature
to cache its results for 5 minutes and use those until it expires. The same goes for
the center of the page where the blog posts are. I don't update that section as often
so it is cached for 15 minutes.<p>

HTML::Mason is sexy.  I'll post more later when I've got more done.
