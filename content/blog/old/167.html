I finally got around to moving the new site design/code to my main site. The
new code is in place on my "real" site, <a
href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/">http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/</a>.
The old site can still be viewed <a
href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/oldb">here</a>. I also stumbled across
the still-older version of this site in php, which can be seen <a
href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/old_php">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The new version of the site is vastly more advanced than previous versions:
<ul>
	<li> 
	Data Caching - all generated data (the project list, etc) is now cached for a given period of time. This means unnecessary database querying is avoided as is unnecessary code execution. Thanks to HTML::Mason's excellent api, caching data is one line of code.
	</li>
	<li>
	Projects list is autogenerated. The projects page is also automatically generated. It looks in projects/ for directories, and those become "projects." The projects page looks in those directories for a file called 'Description' which it will use to put the projects page together.
	</li>
	<li>
	XML! My resume is now written in XML and I have a simple XSLT file that
allows me to generate an html version. Furthermore, there is an articles system
now so I can publish tutorials and papers. With this system, I write the
articles in xml (<a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic//articles/ppp-over-ssh/index.xml">see this example</a>). I then use an xsl sheet to turn the xml into html. The xslt generates a table of contents (<a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic//articles/ppp-over-ssh/index.html">see example here</a>) automatically, complete with working anchor links.
	</li>
	<li>
	Articles and projects are now self-publishing. Whenever I want to make a new project entry or write a new article, I simply make a new project directory or simply write the article and the website will find it and put it up online. This is quite sexy, and keeps me from having to update link entries, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
	The file browser is gone. I never used this, and I wrote it just for fun and so people could view my source code. The old ones are still up though.
	</li>
	<li>
CVS and DARCS commit lists are now viewable. It shows the most recent commits to various projects I have in either CVS or DARCS repositories.
	<li>
</ul>

There are a few more features I still want to add, most notably to reimplement
the script I use to post blog entries (like this one!) to the web. It's a giant
shell script I wrote for entertainment purposes and only ended up using becuase
it worked well. It has some issues of its own due to all the hackery that goes
on in the script. I also want to implement a tagging system so I can
better-classify the entries I make into something more searchable. The history
feature is gone aswell (again, still usable from the old version), so I'll need
to write a new/better one. This will likely be integrated with the tagging
system (why write two independent search features?). Finally, I want all of my pages to be XHTML compliant. Most of them are close, but need to be further fixed up.
</p>
<p>
I continue my efforts to have a content management system that actually manages
everything but the raw content. This is the 3rd time I have written the site
from scratch, every time something new and cool comes out of it.
</p>
<p>
The list of technologies used in the new version is: perl, HTML::Mason, XML,
XSLT, cvs, darcs, and mysql. I plan on adding a few more to the list,
becuase technology is cool and making technologies play nice with eachother
is a lot of fun. I'm heavily considering using more xml/xslt on the site,
becuase writing articles now that I have a nice xslt to turn article xml
into html.
