I couldn't sleep, so I got bored and made the /entries/ part of the site work again. You can now view the list of all blog entries again. Click the 'Archive' link on the left. I kept the original functionality of being able to search for blog entries based on a simple keyword search. You can try it out by going to:
<pre>
<a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/entries/zsh">http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/entries/zsh</a>
</pre>

Changing the <code>zsh</code> part of the url will change what is searched for.
