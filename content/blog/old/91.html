Most of the framework for the new design is done and I'm realising that it is, in fact, 6:30 AM. So, I'm gonna head off to slumberland and finish this up when I wake up later today.<p>

HTML::Mason is definately one of the cooler toys I've played with in a long time.<br>
So, what works right now? The <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/mason">front page</a>, and <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/mason/entries">viewing the history</a>. I also wrote in support for dated entry lookup and searching (as seen in the previous post). For instance, you can do:<br>
<a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/mason/entries/2003/06">http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/mason/entries/2003/06</a><br>
And that drops you at a listing of all posts made in June 2003. Neat :)<p>
Finish this thing up tomorrow.
