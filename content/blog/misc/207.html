BarCamp has been quite awesome thus far, only halfway through it. Definite kudos to the organizers for making it happen.
<p/>

Today's attended presentations included ones on Xen, <a
href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a>, Outsourcing and others. I've been meeting a ton of cool folks here who are very into web technologies and other stuff.

<p/>

I'm presenting tomorrow on JSON, AJAX, and Prototype, and possibly some python stuffs. We'll see how things go.
