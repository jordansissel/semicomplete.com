This isn't particularly software-related, but I figured I'd note it anway.

<p>

I noticed yesterday that despite having a decent TV connected to a digital
cable box, that the image was still ghosted, presumably due to noise. Moving
cables around didn't fix the problem, but in the process I noticed composite
video output on the cable box. I took a shot that using composite would produce
better quality signal and plugged an RCA AV cable in. Viola! Ghosting went
away, and the picture is much less blurry. I wouldn't have expected coax to be
more susceptible to noise, but perhaps the circuitry modulating the coax signal
was picking up noise that the composite video circuitry was not.

<p>

Problem solved.
