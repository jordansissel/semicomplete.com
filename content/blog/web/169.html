Dropping Wendy off at the airport earlier this week reminded me to work on the kiosk interface project I've wanted to work on. I started it today, it uses XML, XSLT, and JavaScript. The current implementation is pretty crappy, but visually it gives you an idea of how things might work.

To be frank, it looks like Any Other Webpage and doesn't appear to have anything special about it, but the cool part comes soon, I guess.
