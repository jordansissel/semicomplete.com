<p/>

Go to 'about:config' in your URL bar in Firefox. If you've never done this before, literally type 'about:config' in the URL bar and hit enter. This will bring up a list of user settings. In the search bar, type 'mouse' and change the following values:

<pre>
mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.action - Set this to '1'
mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.numlines - Set this to '1'
</pre>

The <i>action</i> defaults to 2, which means go forward/back. Annoying.
<p/>

The <i>numlines</i> defaults to -1, which scrolls left when you use the mouse to attempt scrolling right. Setting it to 1 will make it scroll left when you scroll left, as it should.

<p/>
Voila! Horizontal scrolling should now work properly.
