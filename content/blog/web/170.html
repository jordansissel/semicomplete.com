So I'm working on my new touch-based web interface, and I decide that having a pool of widget objects to use would be swell. The first thing I thought I would need would be some kind of on-screen keyboard. A quick glance at the first few google results for 'javascript on screen keyboard' showed nothing promising. So, I started reading about object-oriented javascript, and an hour or two later I have a keyboard.
<p/>
Now I have a keyboard widget I can load at any time. Huzzah!
