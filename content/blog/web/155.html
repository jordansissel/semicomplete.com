I got bored and decided to play with greasemonkey. The results are
somewhat crude but it works and I think I like it better than my current
solution to interface with del.icio.us.<p/>

<a

delicious.user.js</a>
<p/>
Requires: Firefox, the greasemonkey extension, and a del.icio.us account
(free)

<p/>

For those out of the Know: Greasemonkey is a sexy extension for Firefox
that lets you execute "user" scripts whenever a page loads. This lets
you add functionality, remove banner adds, clean up pages, change
themes, etc of pages you are viewing. This prospect is extremely
exciting.<p/>

Since the Mozilla family support xpath and other neat things in its
javascript engine, you can do huge set of actions on the pages you view.
This includes using xpath to find advertisements and deleting those
elements, for instance. The possibilities are potentially limitless. I
highly recommend people having a gander.<p/>
