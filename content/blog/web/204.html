I recieved a report from someone about the keyboard widgety thing I wrote not
working under IE. I took this as an opportunity to rewrite it slightly. The end
result is that it is completely object-oriented now and works in Firefox, IE,
and Opera.

The new version makes use of addEvent written by Dean Edwards. I was very
pleased with it's cross-browserness :)
