Add lacking dynamic assignment ability to my "I wish Python had Foo" list.
<p>

Python does not appear to have dynamically assignable arrays. Where are we, C? Assembly? When I assign past the end of the array, I mean resize the god damned array. Thanks.

<p>

<pre>
nightfall(~) % python -c "foo = []; foo[3] = 234"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in ?
  IndexError: list assignment index out of range
</pre>

This is completely unacceptable.

Sure, I can use list comprehensions to make an N element array that's empty:
<pre>
foo = [None for x in range(100)]
foo[44] = "Hi"
</pre>

That only gets me an array with 100 empty elements. Uh.. Not what I want. If I
did this on an array with data in it I didn't want to lose, I'd lose all the
data.

<p>

Sigh...
