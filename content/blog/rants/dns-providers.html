Happy Halloween, folks. It's been 20 days since my last post. I've been
incredibly busy with work and haven't had a chance to write. As a gift, I give
you a rant.

<p>

I've been through no less than 3 DNS service providers in the past week, and
all of them suck. They suck hard. 

<p>

The first one I looked at was no-ip. No-IP claims they support 'dynamic dns' -
they don't. The first thing you must realize about almost all dns providers is
that while they claim they support "dynamic dns" and/or "round robin," what
they really mean is their support of 'dynamic dns' is based solely around one
single use case. One. 

<p>

What is that use case? The following picture comes from dynu.com:

<center><img src="/images/howbasicworks.gif"></center>

<p>

What is this? This use case of one computer updating it's own hostname with
whatever IP it happens to have at that moment. Businesses can't possibly find
this useful. It doesn't scale. If you have more than one server you want to put
on a single hostname, this use case fails you miserably.

<p>

I've looked at no-ip, dyndns, dnspark, and several others. Trash.

<p>

Keep in mind, this rant is becuase both free AND pay-for dns providers suck.
Both kinds. Free services actually have an excuse - you get what you pay for.

<p>

As a precursor, let me explain what I need from a dns provider:

<ol>
  <li> The ability to add and remove dns entries of any record type, at any time. </li>
  <li> The ability to add multiple entries for the same record </li>
</ol>

Many claim these features. Those I tried fail miserably.

<p>

If you are in the market for a real dns provider, as I am, you'll find many dns
providers claiming what I listed above. "Sure! We support round robin!" they
advertise, "We support dynamic dns!" 

<p>

What they don't tell you in the same paragraph is that you have to use their
own HTTP-based means of pushing dns changes. They absolutely don't tell you
that their pathetic attempt at providing this "dynamic" service via a cgi-like
interface is absolutely crippled.

<p>

Several providers allowed you to mutate records dynamically. However, none of
them I tried let me add multiple entries for a single record using the dynamic
interface.

<p>

<b>An important realization</b> is that my definition of dynamic is not the
same as these dns providers' notion of dynamic. This so-called dynamic dns
ability hinges on customers who want to be able to host crap out of their
dynamic-ip-giving ISP. As such, most of the interface is just "Hey DNS
provider! Please update www.foo.com with whatever IP this packet is coming
from! Thanks!" This is intolerable!

<p>

What is my definition of "dynamic dns," exactly? Let's call it <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2136.txt">RFC 2136</a>. Heck, I don't care if it's not RFC 2136, just that I'm able to do most things that update specification provides.

<p>

To quote ZoneEdit customer support regarding my issues with their service and
in particular how to properly use their crippled dynamic update interface:

<blockquote>
"You can atleast update hourly .
<p>
Updating too often with the same IP address gets your account locked up."
</blockquote>

WHAT?! Once hourly? Shit. DNS is hard. Let's go shopping instead.
<p>

Doing this right <b>is not hard</b>. For example, I recently posted 
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/articles/dynamic-dns-with-dhcp/">an article</a>
on how to setup dynamic dns and make your dhcp server talk sweetly to dns. I
use this same configuration in my apartment. MY APARTMENT. My apartment is
considerably smaller than, say, a multidatacenter dns provider. Why doesn't
anyone at any of these dns providers have a freaking clue about running a dns
server? Let me put it plainly:

<blockquote> 
<b>I will give you <font color="green">money</font> and you will give me a
dnssec key and a server on which to use it. That shall be the extent of our
relationship</b>
</blockquote>

That's all I want. The worst part is that it doesn't matter who you go with.
There are plenty of free dns providers who provide you the same crappy service
as give-us-your-money providers.

<p>

Really. Come on kids.

<p>

Look at it this way - To enable dynamic dns updates, you don't need to write
any code. A few tiny named.conf changes. To provide a pathetic http interface
you label as "dynamic dns" requires lots of lines of code, lots of testing, and
$$$ invested in this kind of product. 

<p>

To further show how stupid this is. Microsoft supports this properly.
Microsoft. You know, that company everyone hates-on for proprietary protocols
and ignorance of standards? Microsoft DNS will send updates using BIND's update
protocol. How do I know this? I've had a primary dns server running BIND and
Microsoft DNS running as a secondary. I told Active Directory that it's primary
dns was the BIND server. Guess what happened? Active Directory happily
submitted updates to my BIND server. Correctly.

<p>

You might be thinking to yourself, "Why don't you just host dns yourself?"
Because I dont' have any servers on a static IP address. And no, this isn't
running out of my apartment.

<p>

Am I the only one who can't find a dns provider that doesn't suck?
