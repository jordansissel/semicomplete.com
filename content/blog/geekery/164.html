<p>
Logwatch is gradually getting sexier as I throw more ideas and time into it. This recent batch of updates added, primarily, the following:
</p>

<p>
Users can define their own patterns in logwatch.conf:
<pre>
patterns {
	clientandip = "\[client %IP%\]";
	hostname = "(\[wd-\]+.)*(\[w-\])";
};
</pre>
Defines your own patterns in addition to the default ones. These new patterns are used the same way that default patterns are, as <code>%clientandip%</code> and <code>%hostname%</code>. A sample use of this would be:
<pre>
file "/var/log/auth.log" {
	type "failed hostname lookup" {
		match = "reverse mapping checking getaddrinfo for %hostname% failed";
		threshold = 2;
		interval = 60;
		reaction = "echo 'Someone (%hostname%) is trying to ssh with broken dns... maybe they are being naughty?'";
	};
};
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Patterns can be pretty much any regular expression perl will support. Also, as you can see with the <code>clientandip</code> pattern, you can embed existing patterns in new patterns. This includes your own patterns. Recursion is limited to 10 levels by default, this may change in the future.
</p>
