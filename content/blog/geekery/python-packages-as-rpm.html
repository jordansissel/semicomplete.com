I was working on a new python 2.6 rpm to push at work and started wondering
about how to get python eggs to become rpms. Ruby has a gem package called
gem2rpm that aids in generating rpms from ruby gems, but there's not really an
egg2rpm project.

<p>

We're in luck, though. Python's setuptools supports generating rpms by default,
it seems. Those 'python setup.py' invocations you may be accustomed to can
trivially generate rpms.

<p>

The secret sauce is the 'bdist_rpm' command given to setup.py:

<pre>
% wget -q http://boto.googlecode.com/files/boto-1.8d.tar.gz
% tar -zxf boto-1.8d.tar.gz
% cd cd boto-1.8d
% python setup.py bdist_rpm
% find ./ -name '*.rpm'
./dist/boto-1.8d-1.noarch.rpm
./dist/boto-1.8d-1.src.rpm
</pre>

Piece of cake. I've tried this on a handful of python packages (boto, simplejson, etc), and they all seem to produce happy rpms.

<p>

However, if you have multiple versions of python available, you'll want to explicitly hardcode the path to python:

<pre>
% python setup.py bdist_rpm --python /usr/bin/python2.6
% rpm2cpio dist/boto-1.8d-1.noarch.rpm | cpio -it | grep lib | head -3
2745 blocks
./usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/boto-1.8d-py2.6.egg-info
./usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/boto/__init__.py
./usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/boto/__init__.pyc
</pre>

The default python on this system is python 2.4. Doing the above forces a build
against python2.6 - excellent, but maybe we're not quite there yet. What if you
need this package for both python 2.4 and 2.6? For this, you'll need separate
package names.

However, the bdist_rpm command doesn't have a way of setting the rpm package
name. One way is to hack setup.py with the new name:

<pre>
% grep name setup.py
setup(name = "boto",
% sed -re 's/name *= *"([^"]+)"/name = "python24-\1"/'  setup.py &gt; setup24.py
% grep name setup24.py
setup(name = "python24-boto",

# Now build the new rpm with the new package name, python24-boto
% python setup24.py bdist_rpm --python /usr/bin/python2.4
</pre>

For our boto package, this creates an rpm with a new name: python24-boto. This
method is good (hack the setup.py script) because the command to build the rpm
stays basically the same. The alternative would be to use 'python setup.py
bdist_rpm --spec-only' and edit the spec file, then craft whatever rpmbuild
command was necessary. The method above is less effort and trivially
automatable with no knowledge of rpmbuild or specfiles. :)

<p>

Repeat this process for python26, and now we have two boto rpms for both pythons.

<pre>
% rpm -Uvh python2?-boto-*noarch.rpm
Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
   1:python26-boto          ########################################### [ 50%]
   2:python24-boto          ########################################### [100%]

% python2.4 -c 'import boto; print True'
True
% python2.6 -c 'import boto; print True'
True
</pre>

Excellent.
