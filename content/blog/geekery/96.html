So I got bored and started working on an aim client written, you guessed it, in perl. It's console-based and will eventually be very similar to 
<a href="http://users.tmok.com/~smike/">tac</a>, but better. Eventually once I
get some bugs and basic features nailed out I'm going to attempt to write both
Gtk2 and Curses::UI front-ends for it.<p>

Right now it supports the most basic of features including logging in, messaging, receiving messages, get user info, and aliases. Aliases can be nested, that is you can do:<br>
<pre>
/alias foo /msg psikronic
/alias bar /foo Hello!
</pre>
and then call <code>/bar</code> and it will call <code>/foo Hello!</code> which will in-turn call <code>/msg psikronic Hello!</code>. Huzzah.
<p>
I also added a <code>/default</code> command which will set the default target to send messages to. You can also do <code>; some message text</code> to message the person who messaged you most recently (prefix the line with semi-colon). You can also do /default ; to set the default to the person who most recently messaged you.
