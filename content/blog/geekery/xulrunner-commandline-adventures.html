<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Chrome:_Command_Line">Oh my
god.</a> If you followed the link, you surely noticd the 170ish lines in the
example that shows you how to make use of command-line arguments from
JavaScript. I totally forgot how nasty it is to often to simple things in
XUL/XPCOM-land.

<p>
In my adventures of searching for telling teaching a small xulrunner
application I'm working on to use the commandline, I found <a
href="http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Crowbar">Crowbar</a>, a project out of MIT
that's pretty neat. 

<p>

Basically I wanted the power of my xpathtool but twist it with some help from
jQuery. A command-line jquery tool would let you do some pretty neat things
with web scraping. Crowbar can already do the page fetching, but I want to do
more. And no, by 'command-line jquery tool' I certainly do not mean <a href="http://jquery.com/blog/2007/06/01/new-command-line-jquery-tool/">this command line jquery documentation tool</a>.

<p>

My frustration with XPCOM's burden-the-programmer design has me at the end of
my patience for tonight. Basically I suck at XPCOM in JavaScript. I'll keep at
it though, maybe something useful will come out.
come out of it.

<p>

<b>Update:</b> Neat! While surfing through Crowbar's code for how they handle commandline arguments, I found this beauty:

<pre>
/*
 * Process a series of command line arguments and modify default settings
 */
function processCommandLineArgs() {
  var nsCommandLine = window.arguments[0];
  nsCommandLine = nsCommandLine.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsICommandLine);
  port = getCommandLineArg(nsCommandLine, 'port', port);
}
</pre>

So, I try this out myself:

<pre>
&lt;window xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"
        onload="alert(window.arguments[0].QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsICommandLine).getArgument(0))" /&gt;
</pre>

And run xulrunner:
<pre>
% xulrunner application.ini happypants
</pre>

The result is this: <br>
