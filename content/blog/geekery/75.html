While perusing manpages (col, specifically) I found that terminals respond to <i>^N</i> by switching to an alternate character set (a drawing set, perhaps) while <i>^O</i> will switch back to normal.<p>

I often <code>cat</code> things I should not, and end up borking my terminal display, typing <code>echo "<i>^V^O</i>"</code> where <i>^V</i> is CTRL+V and <i>^O</i> is CTRL+O. This will echo <i>^O</i> to your terminal and reset your character set.
