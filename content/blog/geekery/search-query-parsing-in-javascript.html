For pimp, I want to be able to search a specific column, say, artist, without
needing multiple fields for searching. The ability to specify more advanced
searches than simple keywords is quite useful. How do we leverage this on the client and turn a search query into a set of key-value pairs?

<p>

I must confess I was hesitant to put this kind of logic into Javascript instead
of Python. Furthermore, it makes me feel a little uneasy using <i>/foo/</i> in
anything other than Perl. Nonetheless, doing this in Javascript was simple and
it's still fast (as it should be).

<p>

The particular type of query I want to parse come in the following (hopefully
intuitive) formats:

<ul>
  <li> foo </li>
  <li> artist:Eminem </li>
  <li> album:"Across a Wire" </li>
  <li> artist:"Counting Crows" album:august </li>
</ul>

The following code does this for me. The <code>parse_query</code> function will
return a dictionary of query terms. Values are lists.

<p>

Here's an example:
<dl>
  <dt> Query </dt>
  <dd> <code> rain baltimore artist:"Counting Crows" album:august </code> </dd>
  <dt> Results of parse_query </dt>
  <dd> <pre>
    { "artist": ["Counting Crows"],
      "album": ["august"],
      "any": ["rain", "baltimore"],
    }
  </pre> </dd>
</dl>

I take the dictionary returned and pass it to <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>'s
<code>$.post</code> function to execute an AJAX (I hate that term, it's such a
misnomer these days) request. Here's the code:

<pre>
query_re = /(?:"([^"]+)")|(?:\b((?:[a-z:A-Z_-]|(?:"([^"]+)"))+))/gi,

function parse_query(string) {
  dict = {}
  while (m = query_re.exec(string)) {
    val = (m[1] || m[2]).split(":",2)
    if (val[1]) { key = val[0]; val = val[1]; }
    else { key = "any"; val = val[0]; }

    val = val.replace(/"/g,"");

    dict[key] = dict[key] || [];
    // the following should be .append(val) but 
    // I don't think javascript lists have them
    dict[key][dict[key].length] = val;
  }

  return dict;
}
</pre>
