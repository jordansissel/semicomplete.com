While looking over the default tripwire policy that comes with Ubuntu, I
noticed someone decided that it was important to monitor all of /proc. So, if
you use the default policy in Ubuntu, expect to get emails every time 'tripwire
--check' runs becuase /proc doesn't stay constant.

<p>
The config that comes with tripwire's source code specifically skips monitoring
/proc for obvious reasons, so it was someone downstream (debian? ubuntu?) who
decided /proc should be monitored. Monitoring non-process directories in /proc
on Linux is probably reasonable, but all of /proc is just silly. Here's the
output of "tripwire --check" with the default ubuntu config:

<pre>
Added:
"/proc/21472/task/24343"
"/proc/21472/task/24343/root"
"/proc/21472/task/24343/status"
&lt; hundreds of lines of pointless /proc/PID/ entries lines edited out &gt;
</pre>


Terrible default setting. You're guaranteed to have this report every time even
on a 100% idle system, because tripwire's process entry will show up different
every time it runs.
