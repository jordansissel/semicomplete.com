I installed FreeBSD 6.1 on my corp laptop tonight. The following are notable:

<ul>
<li> acpi_ibm doesn't appear to read much of anything useful. hotkey values work. Little else</li>
<li> cpufreq works </li>
<li> wacom stylus input magic works via X 'wacom' driver. Shows up as /dev/cuad1 </li>
<li> ath0 works </li>
<li> bge0 works </li>
<li> sata works </li>
<li> Tablet buttons (rotate/tools/esc/enter/ctrlaltdel) are received by X (viewable by xev(1)) </li>
</ul>

wacom was not properly calibrated initially. Guess-and-check method of screwing with calibration values made everything happy.

<p>

I'll post configs and other notes later. Naptime.
