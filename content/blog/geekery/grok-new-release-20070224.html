It's been almost a year since the first release of grok. I've finally found
some energy to put into the project and it's time for another release.

<p>

Download: <a href="/projects/grok/grok-20070224.tar.gz">grok-20070224.tar.gz</a>

<p>

A quick summary of the changelist (which comes with the tarball):
<ul>
  <li> Lots of doc updates. More examples in the manpage. </li>
  <li> Lots of new builtin patterns </li>
  <li> More new filters like strftime, ip2host, and uid2user. </li>
  <li> Fancier syslog matching options </li>
  <li> New flags -m and -r. See <a href="/blog/geekery/grok-like-grep.html">this post</a> about this change </li>
  <li> filelist, catlist, and filecmd thanks mostly to Canaan Silberberg. </li>
  <li> More tests to make sure that it works. Find these in the 't' directory in the grok tarball.</li>
</ul>

Email me if the tests provided don't work.
