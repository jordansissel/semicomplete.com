So it seems that there's two ways your terminal can send "meta" key
combinations.<p>

One method is to send escape + the character. So hitting ALT+J will send an
escape character followed by 'J'. <br>
Alternatively, your terminal might simply read the character value in and set
it's most significant bit high before sending that byte to the terminal. What
does does that mean?<br>
Let's say you were to hit ALT+J this time. J, in ascii is 74 in ascii. This
number represented in binary is: <code>01101010</code>. Having alt held down
sets the left-most (most significant) bit high, becoming
<code>11101010</code>.<p>

Many terminals allow you to set which method of input it uses. XTerm, for
instance, allows you through the menu accessed by control+leftclicking on the
terminal (anywhere). Select "Meta sends Escape" and alt-key combinations will
send escape+character. If "Meta sends Escape" is unchecked, then your terminal
will set-high the most significant bit before sending the character.<p>

Here's a perl oneliner that'll let you see what's going on. The output for mat
is: <code> char / ascii / binary </code> where ascii is the hexadecimal value
of what you entered, and binary is the binary representation. You'll notice
that if "Meta sends Escape" is unchecked, then your terminal will set-high the
most significant bit before sending the character.<p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

system("stty raw -echo"); 
while (sysread(STDIN,$foo,1)) {
        printf("%s / %2x - ", ($foo =~ /[[:print:]]/ ? $foo : " "), ord($foo)); 
        print unpack("B32", pack("n", ord($foo))) . "\r\n" 
}

</pre>
