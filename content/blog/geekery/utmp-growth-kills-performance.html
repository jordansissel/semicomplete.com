That's 350 megs and 1.7 gigs. Cute. Performance sucks for anything needing utmp
(w, uptime, top, etc). The 'init' process is spending tons of time chewing
through cpu.  System %cpu usage says 38% and is holding there on a mostly idle
machine.

<p>

Lots of these in  /var/log/messages:
<pre>

irectory

I'm not sure why /dev/tty1 is the only /dev/ttyN device, but whatever. Either
way, mingetty flapping will flood /var/run/[ubw]tmp over the span of weeks and
eventually you end up with a system that spends most of its time parsing that
file and/or restarting mingetty.

<p>

I fixed this by commenting out all tty entries in /etc/inittab and running "init q":
<pre>
# Run gettys in standard runlevels
#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1
#2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2
#3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3
#4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4
#5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5
#6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6
</pre>
