I've gotten quite a bit further tonight on making c++grok's functionality
available in python.

<p>

Mostly tonight's efforts have been spent learning the python C api and learning
how to add new objects and methods. I'm planning to have this ready for
BarCampRochester3 in two weeks.

<p>

So far I can make new GrokRegex objects and call set_regex() and search() on them. Next time I'll be implementing GrokMatch objects (like in the C++ version) and a few other small things. Fun fun :)
