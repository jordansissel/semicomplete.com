I have a fresh workstation and am running through the windows 8 installer on USB.

When choosing the drive to install to, I get an error:

<blockquote>
We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one
</blockquote>

Lots of googling and I didn't find any hints for windows 8, but windows 7 has a
similar error and folks pointed at diskpart nonsense to fix it. So let's do that -

<ul>
<li> At the installer, choose "Repair your computer"</li>
<li> Choose "troubleshoot" </li>
<li> Choose "advanced options" </li>
<li> Choose "command prompt"</li>
<li> Run diskpart.
</ul>

In diskpart, you'll want to make sure your target drive is formatted and active.

<pre>
list disk

# now pick your disk
select disk 0
clear
create partition
format fs=ntfs compress quick
active
</pre>

Now reboot and try the installer again, it worked for me.
