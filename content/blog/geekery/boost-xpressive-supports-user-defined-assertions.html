<p>

Basically this regex library (Boost.Xpressive) supports what I like about
perl's regex engine: The <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlre.pod">(??{ code })</a> feature
(except with different syntax). This means what I had <a
href="/blog/geekery/grok-and-advanced-regex.html">to hack around</a> in
grok-perl I can easily express in C++ code. Awesome.

<p>

The docs only show examples of using static regexes with this great feature.
I'm going to try using it with dynamic regexes. If it works, I'll be converting
grok to C++.
