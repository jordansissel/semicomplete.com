Candice wanted a nonsucky, terminal-based aim client, and I was bored enough to
write one. So after about 3 months of off-and-on development I've got enough
work done on it to safely say it's useable. She and I both use it more or less
regularly now. Including work done on my new module, Term::Shelly, I've decided
to tag a release. tic's mostly bug free at the moment and supports a fair set
of the features in AIM.<p>

<b>Features of tic:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Basic functionality: sending messages, receiving them, checking info, setting away, seeing who's online, etc.
<li> Aliases can be created on demand to do whatever you want. You can cascade aliases aswell, meaning you can have one alias call another.
<li> Logging is supported, logs go to <code>~/.tic/</code>
<li> Persistent settings can be put in <code>~/.ticrc</code>. See below for more info on this.
<li> Tab completion of all commands, aswell as completion of screennames for certain commands (like /msg)
<li> A shortcut for replying to whoever messaged you most recently - typing ; at the beginning of the line will auto fill in "/msg [whoever]" for you. 
</ul>
<p>

You'll need 3 perl modules: <code>Net::OSCAR</code>, <code>Term::ReadKey</code>, and a module I wrote, <code>Term::Shelly</code>. The first two you can get from cpan. However, Term::Shelly hasn't been uploaded yet (I'm lazy) so you'll have to download it from me:<br>
<b><a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/projects/Term-Shelly-0.2.tar.gz">Term::Shelly</a></b><p>

<b>.ticrc syntax</b><br>
The basic syntax is: <code>key = value</code><br>
Comments are prefixed with #, and whitespace between the key, =, and value. The following settings are available:<p>
<ul>
<li> screenname = someusername
<li> password = yourpassword
<li> port = 8080
<li> log = all|off
<li> timestamp = on|off
</ul>
