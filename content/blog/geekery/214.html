I've been working on some code cleanups and documentation for pam_captcha. I
put the code up for download if anyone's interested. There's no pretty project
description page, yet. This updated added syslog logging of captcha failures to
LOG_AUTHPRIV for happy audit trails.

<p>

I also put pam_captcha on one of my servers to see what happens. I use SSH keys
so I'll never see the captcha stuff. I'm interested to see what kinds of brute
force attempts get thwarted.
