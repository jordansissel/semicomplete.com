I had hoped (hope is not a strategy) Fedora would have given me svn 1.5 by now. Nope.

<p>

To get svn 1.5, rather than ask fedora or google, I just built it myself. I
needed to 'yum install neon-devel' and used './configure --with-neon=/usr
--with-ssl --with-zlib=/usr/lib' to configure subversion. Otherwise the
build/install went fine.

<p>

Huzzah!
