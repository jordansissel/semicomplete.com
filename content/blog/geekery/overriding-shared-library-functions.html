Long story short...

<p>

File: 'connect.over' contains
<pre>
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

override(`connect', `
  {
    // code to inject before the connect() call is actually made
  }
')
</pre>

Output is 'connect.so' which overrides libc's connect function.

<pre>
% LD_PRELOAD=./connect.so nc google.com 80
stream connect: fd=3 host=64.233.187.99:80
% LD_PRELOAD=./connect.so nc -u 129.21.60.9 53 
dgram connect: fd=3 host=129.21.60.9:53
% LD_PRELOAD=./connect.so ssh scorn           
stream connect: fd=3 host=129.21.60.26:22
stream connect: fd=4 host=109.112.47.115:12148
scorn(~) %
</pre>

The output by nc was due to my function above outputting this.

<p>

The strange ssh connection on fd=4 above is seemingly due to ssh calling
connect() on a tty? fstat says:
<pre>
jls      ssh         3221    4 /dev        122 crw--w----   ttypd rw
</pre>

inode 122 on /dev is /dev/ttypd.
