The past two days have been a frustrating exercise in working around a perl bug
coupled with putting strong pressure on the limits of perl's regex system. The
battle was won, but perl left some scarring..

<p>

In the last batch of updates in grok, you are now able to specify additional
match predicates to the patterns. For example, if you have: "%IP~/^192/%" it
will match an IP, but only IPs starting with 192.

<p>

This works great if it's the only IP on the line, but what if you want to grep
for an IP starting with 192 on a line with multiple IP addresses? The current
implementation works something like this:

<ol>
  <li> Perform the match for %IP% </li>
  <li> Assert that the matched IP also matches the predicate /^192/ </li>
  <li> If the previous assertion succeeded, continue as normal (react) </li>
  <li> If the assertion failed, drop this line and keep going </li>
</ol>

Let's consider a simple example:

<p>

I want to use %WORD% to match a word. However, I only want a word that has
'foo' in it. Under the current implementation, I might consider using
"%WORD~/foo/%" but this would not work, becuase it would match the first word
only, which may not match 'foo' as well, and fail. Regex predicates should
ideally be involved during the match process, not after. Perl has some crazy
code eval features that let you do this. The following code should work:


<pre>
echo "foo foobar foobaz" \
| perl -nle 'm/(\b\w+\b)(??{ ($^N =~ m@bar@ ? "" : "(?=.\\A)") })/'
</pre>

Basically, the (??{ }) part checks if the captured group also matches 'bar'. If
it doesn't match 'bar' it will inject a regular expression that cannot ever
match (guaranteed negative match). The negative match is accomplished with a
forward-lookahead looking for any character followed by the beginning of the
string (\A), which clearly isn't possible (Neat hack!). The end result is that
$1 should be 'foobar'.

<p>

However, if you try to run this code:
<pre>
$ echo "foo foobar foobaz" \
  | perl -nle 'm/(\b\w+\b)(??{ ($^N =~ m@bar@ ? "" : "(?=.\\A)") })/'
> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>

Perl crashes. It crashes on linux, freebsd, and solaris in various versions and
various permutations of code. It must have to do something with doing other
regular expressions inside code evals running from another regex. It seems like
it smashes the stack in some unpleasant way.

<p>

Frustrating! I spent a few hours trying to fix this without solving the
problem. No luck. Shortly after, an outrageous idea hit me - if it is unsafe to
do regex within regex, why not fork and do the inner regex in another process?

<p>

Sounds crazy, and stupid, and silly? That's because it is. What bug
work-arounds aren't? :)

<p>

That's exactly what I did. I wrote a <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/scripts/regexp-fu.pl">short prototype
script</a>
to test this new subprocess theory. It seems to work! Despite it's outrageous
complexity, it gets the job done and skirts around the perl bug.

<p>

The script matches an IP, and ensure that that IP contains a '5'. Here's an example run:

<pre>
scorn(~) % perl regexp-fu.pl "1.2.3.4 8.1.1.4 1.2.3.5"
1.2.3.4 / (?-xism:5)
8.1.1.4 / (?-xism:5)
1.2.3.5 / (?-xism:5)
Match: 1
Group: 1.2.3.5
</pre>

You can see that it matched 3 IPs, but only the 3rd one had a '5' in it. The
result of the 1 regular expression is that it matched the one I wanted. Finally!

<p>

I used perlbug(1) in an attempt to report this bug, but I have no idea if it
actually sent any email.

<p>

This solution is totally suboptimal, but it works. Given the alternative, perl
crashing, I'll take this solution.
