I spent much of tonight trying to do the least amount of work and get some kind
of python bindings available from the C++ version of Grok.

<p>

Fail.

<p>

I ran into problem after problem with SWIG, all likely becuase I chose to write
c++grok with templates. After failing on that repeatedly, I decided to try out
Boost::Python. Also failure. I wasn't able to find docs explaining how to use
boost::python without Boost's retarded bjam build system! Fine, so I try to use
bjam. After more repeated failing of simply trying to get a hello world example
working with bjam, I think I'm giving up for tonight.

<p>

Here's a request: Don't make me use your retarded build system.

<p>

I fully admit I haven't spent half a lifetime pouring over the Boost::Python
documentation, but should I really have to learn an entirely new make(1)-like
system just to compile things? With SWIG, atleast the errors were readable and
I was able to get things to compile without issue - I just couldn't figure out
quickly how to expose the few templated classes c++grok has.

<p>

I'm closer to a working python module with SWIG, but the Boost::Python syntax
is quite nice and is in pure C++ from what I can tell.

<p>

Ugh! Maybe I'll have better luck next time.

<p>

I found template instantiation in SWIG:

<pre>
%template(SGrokRegex) GrokRegex&lt;sregex&gt;;
%template(SGrokMatch) GrokMatch&lt;sregex&gt;;
...
</pre>

But compiling this breaks because mark_tag in xpressive seems to lack a default
constructor, and the swig-generated code wants to use it?

<pre>
grok_wrap.cpp:3987: error: no matching function for call to 'boost::xpressive::detail::mark_tag::mark_tag()'
/usr/include/boost/xpressive/regex_primitives.hpp:41: note: candidates are: boost::xpressive::detail::mark_tag::mark_tag(int)
/usr/include/boost/xpressive/regex_primitives.hpp:40: note:                 boost::xpressive::detail::mark_tag::mark_tag(const boost::xpressive::detail::mark_tag&)
</pre>

Several of the above errors are emitted when compiling... I'll try more tomorrow.
