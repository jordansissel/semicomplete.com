I finally got my Verizon EVDO card working in FreeBSD.

The following steps are necessary:
<ol>
  <li> Add a new vendor line to sys/dev/usb/usbdevs </li>
  <li> Add a new product line to sys/dev/usb/usbdevs </li>
  <li> Download <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/dot/fbsd_pc5220/ugencom.c">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/dot/fbsd_pc5220/ugencom.c</a>
  <li> Update sys/conf/files with a new entry </li>
</ol>

<h4> usbdevs changes </h4>

In /usr/src/sys/dev/usb/usbdevs, add the following:
<pre>
vendor QUALCOMM3        0x0c88  Qualcomm
product QUALCOMM3 CDMA_MSM      0x17da  CDMA Technologies MSM phone
</pre>

<h4> Download ugencom.c </h4>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/dot/fbsd_pc5220/ugencom.c">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/dot/fbsd_pc5220/ugencom.c"</a>
<p>

Download this to /usr/src/sys/dev/usb/ugencom.c. Now, you need to make a slight change to this file. 
Change the following the following line:

<pre>
        { USB_VENDOR_AIRPRIME, USB_PRODUCT_AIRPRIME_PC5220, -1 },
</pre>

To this:

<pre>
        { USB_VENDOR_QUALCOMM3, USB_PRODUCT_QUALCOMM3_CDMA_MSM, -1 },
</pre>

<h4> Update sys/conf/files </h4>

In /usr/src/sys/conf/files, add the following just after the line containing 'uplcom.c'
<pre>
dev/usb/ugencom.c               optional ugencom ucom
</pre>

<h4> Build your kernel </h4>

Add the following to your kernel:
<pre>
device ucom
device ugencom
</pre>

Rebuild your kernel. This device should show up as a usb serial device: /dev/cuaU0

<h4> ppp.conf </h4>

This is mostly stolen from another fellow, but modified the authname and added
the comment regarding it.

<pre>
# Start by running ppp -ddial evdo  
evdo:
 set device /dev/cuaU0
 set speed 230400
 set dial "ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 \
           \"\" AT OK-AT-OK ATE1Q0s7=60 OK \\dATDT\\T TIMEOUT 40 CONNECT"
 set phone "#777"
 # The authname and authkey are meaningless, but you need to have them set.
 # Verizon's servers don't seem to care what you auth as.
 set authname "doesn't matter"
 set authkey "doesn't matter either"
 set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
 add default HISADDR                    # Add a (sticky) default route
 enable dns
</pre>
