'e' and 'w' are tragically close. They'll kill you.

<p>
A typo caused the untimely demise of my latest nethack venture. I ate a
cockatrice corpse, instead of wielding it, while on the astral plane, poised to
completely decimate the current top score.

This game was way fun. I had built a character that was unstoppable. See what I
had <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/misc/nethack.valkyrie"> in this screen
scrape</a>. I also had another bag of goodies that contained everything
points-wise valuable from <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/misc/nethack.valkyrie_largebox">this large
box</a> I had been storing goodies in.

<p>

While I'm a little sad that the game ended this way, but whatever. Now I can go about my normal project work, since the hold on my life nethack has held on my after-work activities has been broken.
