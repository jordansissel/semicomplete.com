I've recently found myself needing to do one-off scrapers to pull information
from various services. However, using 'w3m -dump' doesn't always suffice when I
need to parse html and maybe throw it at awk.

<p>

I know XSLT and XPath, but I don't know of a good xpath tool for the
commandline. XML::XPath in perl comes with one, but it's not up to my demands.

<p>

So, like most problems I come across, I solved it myself. A simple query of
"Show all external links" is very cumbersome to do in a one-off manner unless
you've got the right tools. Here's how you do basically do it with xpath:

<pre>
//a[not(contains(@href,"semicomplete.com")) and starts-with(@href, "http://")]/@href
</pre>

It's a bit complicated, but whatever, I can express what I want, right? Toss
this along with my new <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/svnweb/xpathtool/">xpathtool project</a>, and
I can find out where the urls are going:

<pre>
% GET www.semicomplete.com \
| ./xpathtool.sh --ihtml \
  '//a[not(contains(@href,"semicomplete.com")) and starts-with(@href, "http://")]'

http://www.viewvc.org/
http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/
... etc ...
</pre>

You can specify that the input is html with '--ihtml'. The output can be chosen
as text, html, or xml. If you specify html or xml output, it will use
&lt;xsl:copy-of&gt; instead of &lt;xsl:value-of&gt; for each node matched.

<pre>
# output in xml, every anchor tag not obviously pointing locally
GET www.semicomplete.com \
| ./xpathtool.sh --ihtml --oxml \
  '//a[not(contains(@href,"semicomplete.com")) and starts-with(@href, "http://")]' \
| head -4

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;toplevel&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://www.viewvc.org/"&gt;ViewVC&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/"&gt;http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/&lt;/a&gt;

  ... etc ...
</pre>
