DC14 has come and gone, and with it went several gallons of liqour.

<p>

This year's focus seemed to be generally on a debugging technique called
fuzzing. Bruce Potter's talk this year was as entertaining as last year's talk,
with the exception that he didn't scream out "Bow to my firewall!" - oh well.
This year he talked about trusted computing; it was a good presentation.
Dan Kaminsky's talk covered a lot of neat things, but I was put off by how full
of himself he seems to be, whatever. I made an effort to attend a dns hackery
talk, but the speaker was horrible at maintaining focus and presenting, so I
left a few minutes into the talk.

<p>

Things I need to play with: squid reverse ssl proxy, scapy, some generic tcp
proxy thing I don't remember the name of, and a host of other new-to-me
technologies. Exploitation for fun and profit, good times!
