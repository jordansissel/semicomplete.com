I spent some time yesterday making backups of things I care about (code,
content here, etc) in two remote places, in case anything should happen. Now
two places are copying down data for me every few days. Backups are easy to
ignore, but critical when you lose data.

<p>

Today, I heard about journalspace going down because it lost data and didn't
have backups. While I don't use the service, so it doesn't affect me, the
failure they experienced makes for a great case study in false data security
and backups. From the front page of journalspace.com:

<blockquote>
Here is what happened: the server which held the journalspace data had two
large drives in a RAID configuration. As data is written (such as saving an
item to the database), it's automatically copied to both drives, as a backup
mechanism.

<br>
<br>

The value of such a setup is that if one drive fails, the server keeps running,
using the remaining drive. Since the remaining drive has a copy of the data on
the other drive, the data is intact. The administrator simply replaces the
drive that's gone bad, and the server is back to operating with two redundant
drives.
</blockquote>

RAID is not a backup solution. RAID can get you, depending on the
configuration, better throughput and/or better data reliability. If you lose a
drive in some raid configurations, the system can continue working normally
without that drive. Backups should copy data somewhere other than the machine
hosting the original data. The page goes on:

<blockquote>
So, after nearly six years, journalspace is no more.
</blockquote>

After almost 6 years nobody had a cron job that backed up data to somewhere
offsite (or a more complex backup system)? Ouch! My condolences to journalspace
and its users on the loss.

<p>

Losing important data unexpectedly will sting you bad if you don't have
appropriate backups. The only thing to do is learn from this mistake and move
on, accepting the consequences of the loss.

<p>

This isn't the first website I've heard of having to shutdown because they
permanently lost data. Learn from their mistakes, keep backups of your stuff!
