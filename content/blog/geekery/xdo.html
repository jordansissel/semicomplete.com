<div class="update">
<b>Update:</b> xdotool is now a full project, see <a
href="/projects/xdotool">this page</a>. It supports much more than just mouse
and keyboard things.
</div>

<p>

Yesterday, I  <a href="/blog/geekery/macro-navigation">talked about macros</a>. I spent some time coding today and I now have a tool that will let you execute raw keyboard and mouse input into X using the XTEST extension.

<p>

The primary example I used was focusing firefox's URL bar without the mouse.
The sequence was this: Switch to Desktop 2 (I press Alt+2), focus firefox's URL
bar (using control+l) and clear it.

<p>

The result is a simple tool I'm tentatively calling 'xdo'. You can download the
source <a href="/files/blogposts/20070618/xdo.c">here</a>. Compile instructions
are at the top of the file.

<p>

The top of xdo.c details the implemented commands, so let's cut to an example:

<pre>
% echo 'key alt+2; sleep 1; key ctrl+l; key BackSpace' | ./xdo
</pre>

It does exactly what you think. The 'sleep' command has values in milliseconds,
and is only necessary to slow down so that events can propgate fast enough
(window focus changes, etc).

<p>

Another reasonable example would be to say "firefox, open a new tab and load the URL in my clipboard":

<pre>
# My clipboard contains a valid url, say, "http://www.google.com/"
(echo "key alt+2; sleep 1; key ctrl+l; key BackSpace;"
 echo "move 55 55; sleep 1; click 2; key Return") | ./xdo
</pre>

Seems complex, but look at what's really happening: Go to desktop 2, focus
urlbar, hit backspace (clearing it), move the mouse cursor to 55,55 (a point
inside the urlbar for me), hit middle mouse button to paste.

<p>

Change "ctrl+l" to ctrl+k (unix firefox) to focus the "Search" box instead, and
change the 'move' command to cursor over the search box to paste instead, and
suddenly you can bind a simple keystroke to search for whatever is in your X
clipboard. Useful.

<p>

One of the neater features is that you can 'type' text:

<pre>
% echo 'type echo hello there; key Return' | ./xdo
echo hello there
% echo hello there
hello there
</pre>
