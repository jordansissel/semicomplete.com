I spent some time putting love into cgrok (uses libpcre) tonight.
<ul>
  <li> Logging facility to help in debugging. Lets you choose what features you
  want logging (instead of lame warn/info/number log levels) </li>
  <li> Added string and number comparison predicates </li>
  <li> Wrote a few more tests which uncovered some bugs </li>
</ul>

I also broke 2000 revisions in subversion. Yay.
