I was working with grok tonight when I noticed this in a randomly-selected
machine's logs:

(I trimed the lines horizontally for content)

<p>

The usual pattern of dictionary-ordered username attempts and two-minute
intervals was there, but the anomaly here was that the source host was
changing.

<p>

This is new to me as it looks like the botnets that walk around trying to brute
force ssh access have gotten distributed. Instead of a single host walking
usernames, multiple hosts are doing it.

<p>

That's awesome.

<p>

As a side note, this probably puts the kibosh on non-collaborative IDS
tools that bans repeated, failed ssh attempts from a single host.
