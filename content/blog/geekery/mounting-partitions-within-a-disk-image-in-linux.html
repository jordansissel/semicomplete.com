When you create a loop device from a disk image with losetup, it doesn't bother
reading the partition table from the disk image so you don't get the nice and
easy access to, for example, /dev/loop0p1 for partition 1.

<p>

FreeBSD seems to get this right, as I recall, but Linux does not.

<p>

fdisk outputs these devices, but they don't exist:

<pre>
% sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop0 | grep '^/'
/dev/loop0p1   *           1        1043     8377866    7  HPFS/NTFS
/dev/loop0p2            1044        2088     8393962+   7  HPFS/NTFS
</pre>

Linux's mount(8) command gives you the '-o offset=XXX' option. The offset is a
byte offset, and lets you decide how far into your disk image you want to
start. However, fdisk doesn't output in bytes, it outputs in cylinders or sectors.

<p>

Not to worry, it helpfully outputs the conversion between the units and bytes:
<pre>
% sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop0 | grep Units
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
</pre>

Knowing this, let's use awk to generate the offsets for us:

<pre>
% sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop0 
  | awk '/^Units/ { bytes=$(NF-1) } /^\// { print $1 "[" $NF "]: mount -o offset=" $3 * bytes }'
/dev/loop0p1[HPFS/NTFS]: mount -o offset=8225280
/dev/loop0p2[HPFS/NTFS]: mount -o offset=17174384640
</pre>

Now simply mount them with 'mount -t ntfs -o loop,offset=XXXX mydiskimage /mnt' or whatever you want :)
