So, I've been reading docs on python's xml stuff, hoping there's something
simple or comes-default-with-python that'll let me do xpath. Everyone
overcomplicates xml processing. I have no idea why. Python seems to have enough
alternatives to make dealing with xml less painful. 

<p>

Standard python docs will lead you astray:

<pre>
kenya(...ojects/pimp/pimp/controllers) % pydoc xml.dom | wc -l
643
</pre>

Clearly, the pydoc for "xml.dom" has some nice things, right? I mean, documentation is clearly an indication that THE THING THAT IS DOCUMENTED BEING AVAILABLE. Right?

<p>

Sounds great. Let's try to use this 'xml.dom' module!

<pre>
kenya(...ojects/pimp/pimp/controllers) % python -c 'import xml; xml.dom'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in ?
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'dom'
</pre>

<b> WHAT. THE. HELL. </b>

<p>

Googling around, it turns out that 'xml' is a fake module that only actually works if you have it the 4Suite modules installed? Maybe?

<p>

Why include fake modules that provide complete documentation to modules that <b>do not exist</b> in the standard distribution?

<p>

Who's running this ship? I want off. I'll swim if necessary.

<p>

As it turns out, I made too-strong of an assumption about python's affinity
towards java-isms. I roughly equated 'import foo' in python as 'import foo.*'
in java. That was incorrect. Importing foo doesn't get you access to things in
it's directory, they have to be imported explicity.

<p>

In summary, 'import xml' gets you nothing. 'import xml.dom' gets you nothing.
If you really want minidom's parser, you'll need 'import xml.dom.minidom' or a
'from import' variant.

<p>

On another note, the following surprised me. I had a module, foo/bar.py. I
figured 'from foo import *' would grab it. This means 'from xml.dom import *'
doesn't get you minidom and friends. 

<p>
Perhaps I was hoping for too much, but maybe it's better to import explicitly.
If that's the case ,then why push exceptions that allow '*' to be imported only
from modules, not packages?
