Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/keynav">keynav project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20080522:
  - Sync xdotool library to 20080521.
  - Added 2 grid examples to keynavrc
  - Applied patches from Richard Kolkovich
    + Fix backwards math when calculating Nth cell when using 'cell-select N'
    + Fix dislexia when doing 'cell-select NxM'
    + Abort update() calls when app is inactive.
  - Now warns you if you try to execute an invalid command.
</pre>

(Yes, 0522 is tomorrow. Turns out uploads to googlecode are write-once, so I'll
need to come up with an additional versioning scheme that lets me push multiple
releases in a single day in case I find something bad after I upload a
release.)
