I've been pretty silent on this site since January. This is because I've been
busy at work and haven't had the time and energy to throw into writing here,
unfortunately. Though, each time I think about my lack of recent writing, I
remind myself that I 'm still well over average for posting since writing 23 of
the 25 articles on <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/">sysadvent</a>.

<p>

Fortunately, I can now open up about the company I work for since we surfaced
two days ago. I work for <a href="http://www.onlive.com/">OnLive</a>.

<p>

As things calm down I should be able to dump more time into writing here.
