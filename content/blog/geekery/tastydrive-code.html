Where is tastydrive.py?

<p>

It was originally available through a stored posting in del.icio.us. I took the
sourcecode off, because I'm not sure what kind of badness would happen should
people start using it. The usage pattern it would generate is completely
different from the standard usage pattern del.icio.us receives currently. I am
going to confer with some Yahoo folk to see if they care.

<p>

Why? Call an ethical hacker, call me whatever. I don't feel like having
del.icio.us get bombarded with this kind of activity. It's a useful service I
don't want to hinder. I'll post more tomorrow when I've had a chance to talk to some Yahoo engineers..
