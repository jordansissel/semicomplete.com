I never really liked C's assert() feature. If an assertion is violated, it'll
tell you what assertion failed but completely lacks any context:

<pre>
example: example.c:9: main: Assertion `i == 3' failed.
</pre>

This is better:

<pre>
Assertion failed insist.c:7 in main(), insist(i == 3): Something went wrong, wanted i == 3, got 4
</pre>

The main difference here is that there's context about what failed. A message
for humans looking to debug this. This is especially important on Linux these
days because every distro I've used recently hates sysadmins and hates
debugging - all libraries are stripped of debug symbols and coredumps are
disabled by default.

<p>

What's the usage look like?

<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "insist.h"

int main() {
  int i = 4;
  //assert(i == 3);
  insist(i == 3, "Something went wrong, wanted i == 3, got %d", i);
  return 0;
} 
</pre>

I also added a special 'return' version of this, 'insist_return' that lets you
do error checking and early aborting like this:

<pre>
insist_return(fd >= 0, START_FAILURE,
              "socket() returned %d, an error: %s", fd, strerror(errno));
</pre>

Works just like insist() except returns START_FAILURE if 'fd > 0' is false and
additionally logs the error formatted above.
