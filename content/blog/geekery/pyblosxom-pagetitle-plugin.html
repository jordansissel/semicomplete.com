The page titles pyblosxom provides are usually great. However, when there is
only one entry displayed, I feel it would be better to rely on that entry's
title.

<p>

I wrote a very short plugin to do just that. Turns out the plugin api for
pyblosxom is quite easy to understand, and this hack was only about 10 lines.

<p>

pagetitle.py adds a new variable which will contain the standard
page title, unless there is only one entry in view. If there is only one entry
in view, the page title is augmented with the story title aswell. This makes
search engine results and browsers happier, as they can recognize what your
page is about by the title. User experience good, also good for search engines.

<p>

The new variable you want to use is:

$blog_title_or_entry_title

<p>

If you want to get a better idea of what this plugin does, you can click the
permalink below to view only this entry. The page title (in the url bar) should
now reflect this entry's title.
