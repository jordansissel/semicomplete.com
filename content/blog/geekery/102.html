XSLT is pretty neato. You can do basic operations (looping, comparisions, math, etc) with the intention of translating XML into something else, such as HTML.<br>
I got bored tonight and decided to play with it and the results are kinda neato.<br>
Some links to an awesome tutorial on XSLT (and XPath):<br>

Anyhoo, check it out:<br>
