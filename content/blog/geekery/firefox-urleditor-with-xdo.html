You'll need xdotool and these 3 scripts for this example:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="/scripts/ffue"> ffue </a> (firefox url edit) </li>
  <li> <a href="/scripts/ffup"> ffup </a> (firefox url paste) </li>
  <li> <a href="/scripts/run-xterm"> run-xterm </a> (run an xterm my way) </li>
</ul>

Then just run 'ffue' and it'll open up vi with the current url split so you can
edit it. Save+quit and it'll unsplit it and use ffup to go to the modified url.
