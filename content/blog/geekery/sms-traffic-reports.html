Combining xulrunner, the Google Maps API, procmail, and imagemagick, I now have
a way to request traffic data from google maps, all from my phone using only
email (sms/mms).

<p>

The project itself isn't very polished, so I won't publish its location.
However, I forwarded one traffic message from my phone to flickr. <a
href="http://flickr.com/photos/jordansissel/2059563268/">View it here</a>. The
picture is rotated because my phone's screen is taller than it is wide.

<p>

The entire process takes about 20 seconds (grab the map, screencapture, and
email back to the phone).
