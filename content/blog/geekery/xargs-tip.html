Under normal circumstances, I use this kind of xargs invocation:

<pre>
xargs -n1 -I@ sh -c 'wget http://@/ | sed -e "s/^/@ /"'
</pre>

The one argument passed to each invocation is replaced by '@'. This sucks if you have awkward characters such as quotes. Instead, use sh's argument processing.

<p>

<pre>
# Failed invocation due to quotes:
easel(~) % echo "one\n'\"two'\nthree" | xargs -n1 -I@ sh -c 'echo "@"'
one
sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
three

# Successful invocation:
% echo "one\n'\"two'\nthree" | xargs -n1 sh -c 'echo "$1"' - 
one
"two
three
</pre>

The trailing - is required, because sh will set $0, $1, etc, based on those arguments. For example:

<pre>
% sh -c 'echo "$0, $1"' foo bar
foo, bar
</pre>

In an effort to use the shell "properly" I use $1 and pass - as the $0
argument. This lets you do neater things that the <code>-I</code> flag doesn't,
such as multiple arguments in a given invocation.

<p>

<pre>
% echo "one\ntwo\nthree\nfour" | \
  xargs -n2 sh -c 'echo $1 and $2' -
one and two
three and four
</pre>

Super useful.
