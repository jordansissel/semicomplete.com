I gave a lecture on Unix basics this past friday in building 70. Attendance was
about 20, which was far more than I expected. It was open to anyone who wanted to attend.

<p>

The slides can be found in the link below. They are html-based, and may require you to use a non-sucky browser to view them. I have not tested if browsers other than Firefox work, but I have heard that Opera and Safari choke on it. I'll fix that later.

<p>

If you've never used my slide tool before, here's how:
<ul>
	<li> arrow keys (left/right) navigate back/forward </li>
	<li> spacebar goes forward </li>
	<li> 't' will toggle showing of the slide list. </li>
</ul>
