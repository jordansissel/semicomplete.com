Having accidentally found a means to completely knock my friend's laptop
offline, I sat down and did some research into why and how it happened. Like
most of my researching endeavors, I found more information that I had intended.
Like the article says in the preface, all of the information presented in the
article is probably not new or innovative. In fact, I'd wager that it's public
knowledge in the security community. 

<p/>
Whatever, it is new to me. Read if you so desire :)
