I've only gotten a few hits on my honey pot, and none of the bots seem to be
doing much. I think it might be because the shell I have setup doesn't behave
correctly. Here's the new one:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
d="$(date "+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")"
logfile="/var/log/traps/$d"
env &gt; $logfile
echo "Args: $*" &gt;&gt; $logfile
export SHELL=/bin/bash
script -c "$SHELL $*" -q -a $logfile
</pre>

This will log the env vars in addition to the arguments passed to the shell.
Thus far, I've see 2 patterns of environment variables.

<p>

This new version supports arguments, so that things like 'ssh user@host
somecommand' works. The next step is probably to have a setuid program chown
the logfile to root shortly after script(1) starts, so that you can't remove
your own log. I'll only bother with that if it's necessary.

<p>

In addition to the shell change, I started looking into the audit facility in
Linux. I want to log all command execution, in case my script(1) idea fails. To do this, I added these rules with auditctl:
<pre>
auditctl -a exit,always -F uid=60000 -S open
auditctl -a exit,always -F uid=60000 -S execve
auditctl -a exit,always -F uid=60000 -S vfork
auditctl -a exit,always -F uid=60000 -S fork
auditctl -a exit,always -F uid=60000 -S clone
</pre>

I'm not entirely sure if this will specifically catch the execs I'm looking
for, but it does seem to work:

<pre>
% ausearch -sc execve | grep EXECVE
type=EXECVE msg=audit(1199138086.041:3293): a0="/bin/bash" a1="-c" a2="uptime"-
type=EXECVE msg=audit(1199138086.056:3300): a0="uptime"-
</pre>
