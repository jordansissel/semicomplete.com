I haven't updated the codebase available from the xmlpresenter project page in
a while, but development still continues on it as I do more presentations.

<p/>

Today's update was to add printability to the slides. This is done by using the <code>media="print"</code> part of the &lt;link&gt; tag.

<pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen,projection" href="presenter.css"/&gt;

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href="printview.css"/&gt;
</pre>

When you print, a different css will be applied than 'presenter.css' - very cool.

<p/>

Specific changes are:
<ul>
	<li>all slides are shown</li>
	<li>slide titles use a smaller font, and lack borders</li>
	<li>slides with no titles are not printed </li>
</ul>

Useful, I suppose, if you want to print out your slides in "outline" form.
