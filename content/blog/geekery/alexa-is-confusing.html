According to alexa.com:
<ul>
  <li> Traffic Rank for semicomplete.com:  559,376 </li>
  <li> Rank in Spain: 13,257 </li>
</ul>

Google Analytics believes this to be different. While Analytics doesn't give me
traffic rank, it does tell me that the majority of the viewers come from the US
and some of Europe (Mostly UK, North East and West US). Not Spain. Analytics
watches everyone who comes to semicomplete.com.

I wonder where Alexa is getting it's data from.

<b>Update</b> - Brock pointed out that since pain is smaller than the US, that might account for my extremely-high rank. I left out some data becuase I was being lazy in this post, here it is:

This says that 41% of the viewers come from Spain. Again, Google Analytics
disagrees. My only guess at this point is that of those who visit my site,
Alexa is able to track spaniards better? Maybe it's some toolbar thing that
reports usage data. Brief looking around at alexa.com doesn't provide anything
useful.

Googling shows

explanation</a>. Yep. Toolbar.
