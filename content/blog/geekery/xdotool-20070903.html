Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20070903:
  * Add xdo_mousemove_relative for relative mouse movements
  * Add xdolib.sh. This is a script library to help with features xdo does not
    explicitly implement, such as querying window attributes, or fetching the
    root window id. An example which uses this is: examples/move_window_away.sh
</pre>
