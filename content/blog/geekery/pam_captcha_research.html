In /var/log/auth.log today, I see:

<pre>
Jul 19 04:37:21 dns sshd[5072]: Invalid user test from 211.154.254.73
Jul 19 04:37:22 dns sshd[5074]: Invalid user guest from 211.154.254.73
Jul 19 04:37:26 dns sshd[5080]: Invalid user user from 211.154.254.73
</pre>

No authentication failures, just invalid user notifications.

<p>

FreeBSD has (for a while?) disabled simple "password" authentication in it's base sshd config. What does this mean? If client connects requesting only "password" authentication, it will be rejected. Period. Example:

<pre>
dns(~) !255! % ssh -o "PreferredAuthentications password" happytest@dhcp
Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).
</pre>

If you check /var/log/auth.log, you'll see:
<pre>
Jul 19 06:10:32 dns sshd[5403]: Invalid user happytest from 192.168.0.252
</pre>

However, try the same with a valid user. Nothing is logged (by default). Still,
you are denied outright.

<p>

The important point, is that I guess pam_captcha is not necessary at this time.
Every ssh client I have used has supported both public-key and
keyboard-interactive authentication, so disabling 'password' everywhere should
be a viable option. FreeBSD disables password auth by default, and no one seems
to be complaining.

<p>

If you're worried about brute force attacks over ssh, then just disable
'password' authentication.  In sshd_config:

<pre>
PasswordAuthentication no
</pre>

This probably requires that you use public-key or keyboard-interactive (PAM) to authenticate. Keeps normal users happy, and blocks brute force bots. That is, until the bot scripts are updated to use keyboard-interactive, perhaps? Who knows...
