After reading some more RRDTool documentation, I've found some behavior
detection features. I have not attempted to use this yet, but am eager to try.
For information on this behavior detection and forecasting feature, read the
rrdcreate manpage and search for "Aberrant Behavior" or "Holt-Winters
Forecasting"

<p>

I am not sure how the algorithm works, but reading about it gives me some
confidence in it's ability. Testing is required
