I was happily moving along doing windows automation tonight, when suddenly
sysprep broke. I'm sure I killed it by accident, or something. Googling around
for the error found <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947212">this
knowledgebase article</a> explaining that there is no way to recover and,
quote, "When you experience this error, you must re-create the image. You
cannot correct the problem with the image."

<p>

Fuck that.

<p>

If you read the docs on using sysprep/wsim/windows aik/whatever, they all point
you at building a 'reference computer' which entails lots of manual work
modifying settings and installing things. Sysprep can make useless all of your
precious work? Sweet!

<p>

I'm just glad most of the things I've done to this system were automated so I
can just reinstall and rerun the scripts.
