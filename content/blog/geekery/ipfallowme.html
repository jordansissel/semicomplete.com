The dev box at work has a new, more strict set of ipf rules now. In an effort not to have to change the global rule set, I wrote a little script to pick out your ip from an ssh session and add a few rules based on that ip.<p>

There are probably already scripts that do this out there, but I didn't bother looking.<p>

How it works: <br>
- Create a rule file<br>
- Make sure none of these rules are in the existing ipf rule set<br>
- Apply the generated ruleset (won't overwrite or delete any existing rules)<br>
- Wait until you kill the process or logout if you've backgrounded it, then remove
  the new rules you added.<br>
