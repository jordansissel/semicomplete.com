I started the decade still in high school, as a junior, with after-school
activities including track, marching band, and computer team. Already building
my late-night hacking habits, I spent the late hours doing things like
scripting in mircscript. Computer team was QBASIC or C++, but most of us
used QBASIC, including me, despite having easily passed AP Computer Science the
year prior (which taught C++). 

<p>

I remember trying C++ outside of the AP class, but the C++ they taught us used
this horrible bastard misimplementation what looked like STL - instead of
"vector" you'd use "apvector" etc... which I couldn't find anywhere outside of
class and thus ended my C++ adventures. Here's a tip for teachers and
professors: Always use practical material when doing introductory material.
Don't create some crap sandbox that isn't useful knowledge outside of the
classroom.

<p>

I started my computer science degree at RIT in 2001 and joined the <a
href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/">Computer Science House</a> (CSH). CSH turned out to
be the best part of college by a large measure. From many perspectives, CSH is
the best part about RIT: social, learning, common ground, etc. Classes were
sometimes interesting, but were often boring and unchallenging. This fact
explains why I had a 2.8 GPA when graduating in 2006.

<p>

I socialed my way (by knowing professors) into some senior-level IT classes
without any prerequisites. I remember them being fun, but mostly I remember the
fleet if whiney IT students complaining of the work which I viewed as necessary
and also exciting. I took two or three senior IT classes, and the whining was
consistent throughout. Kind of depressing, because I was still trying to find
an environment outside of CSH where folks actually cared about what they were
doing. This student culture seemed to cause RIT to dumb-down it's IT program
frequently while I was enrolled. I don't know if it's improved.

<p>

School also helped push me to like meritocracy. One summer co-op, I worked for
a professor, who's PhD thesis we were implementing in code. When we had
questions about implementation problems, the professor gave us the "I don't
know" response. I'm implementing your idea, and you don't know? And you got a
doctorate from this? I lost respect for master and PhD status after that; I
treat them now like any certification and mostly ignore them. 

<p>

Respect and status is earned, not given. Apparently PhDs and master awards are
sometimes given, not earned.

<i>My <a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com">code</a> growth over 7 years</i>
</center>
</div>
From 2002 to today, there are more than 70 projects in my svn repo. Linux,
Solaris, FreeBSD, and Windows projects are here. C, C++, Perl, Python, Ruby,
JavaScript, XML, and more. It is totally overwhelming to consider all of the
things I've worked on over the past few years, so I'll just pick a few.

<p>

I started learning PHP in early 2002, then Perl in late 2002, Python in 2004,
Ruby in 2007. The first version of this site was written in PHP, then redone in
Perl and HTML::Mason, then I migrated to pyblosxom.

<p>

In late 2002, I found out
about RSS; a friend said I should write an rss aggregator, so I did. I used
this project as an excuse to learn perl. I wrote the first version of the
aggregator was written using perl CGI and DBI, even had a few folks besides me
using it. I let the project die after I didn't really gain from having an rss
reader.

<p>

Another project was an awesome jukebox software called Pimp. Pimp started as local
mp3 player in perl, then became a telnet-controlled jukebox system written.
Later versions were in python and sported a decent <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/pimp.png">web interface</a>, multiple
simultaneous streams, and some othe cool features. For streaming, I had to
reverse engineer the shoutcast protocol to add the <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/pimptitles.png">in-stream metadata</a>
(showing you what song is playing). 

<p>

In 2003, I wrote an aim client in <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/tic.png">perl using Net::OSCAR</a>. I
used it for a year or two, and don't remember why I stopped. That project
taught me a lot about terminal interfaces. I also came up with some clever
regular expression tricks for doing line editing.

<p>

I've learned a great deal of things outside of code, too. I've read <a
href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/">Rands in Repose</a> and Eric Raymond's <a
href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">Hacker Howto</a>. Communication
mediums like BarCamp, IRC, Twitter, and others are also important here. These
have helped me find communities, large and small, like similar to what I had at
CSH.

<p>

Then there's my career path. Ultimately, I'm a hacker at heart, so I'm looking
for challenging problems to solve. Through college and my early jobs, I've
learned more about what I need to help me focus on solving challenging
problems. I want an environment that is supportive and productive. I want
active communication, especially about blocking issues or direction changes. 

<p>

I've also discovered that I enjoy learning from mistakes. It is difficult to own
up to failures of any size and scope, but I find it is more educational,
personally, to admit failures and move on to work on learning from those
failures. I've had the C-level folks at my current job (Rocket Fuel) explain
this exact thing during meetings - about a problem that was quickly
acknowledged, responded to, repaired, and post-mortemed. That's responsibility
and passion.

<p>

I joined Google immediately after graduating from RIT (seriously, I graduated
on friday, and started work on the monday). I knew nothing of negotiations,
only that I knew I wanted to work there. As a result, I got a crap salary with
crap stock. Now I know. Always negotiate. I left Google for OnLive and it's
technical challenge. As a side note, my career at Google was
going no where; after almost two years, I hadn't really moved, despite some
effort, in areas of greater responsibility or in technical challenge. 

<p>

I left OnLive because the company was going nowhere. Terrible leadership, poor
communication, nepotism, and irresponsibility permeated the employee stack up
to (and especially) the C-level folks. If successful startups need great people
to succeed, then I can only conclude that OnLive will fail. Leaving was a
pity, for me, because the exciting technical challenge was still there. My
favorite response from management when I talked to them about company-wide
problems was "Wait 3 months" - waiting is hoping, and hope is not a strategy.
Despite that, I did stay longer, and that was a mistake. 

Their other senior operations sysadmin guy left shortly after me for the same
reasons. Now, I'm a stock holder and also have friends there, so I still hope
OnLive does great things, but again, hope is not a strategy.

<p>

Both Google and OnLive gave me great perspective and input on what I should
look for in future employment.

<p>

More career-wise, I continue to have high expectations of my coworkers and
especially of leadership. I value responsibility and passion more than I do
technical prowess, because responsibility and passion are more rare qualities
and are at least as valuable as technical prowess. I expect good communication.
I like to ask 'why' questions, and I expect that an answer of "I don't know"
should immediately followed by "but I will find out". Living in the dark is
counterproductive. I've learned to be patient and learned to translate.
Translation is critical. Using a common syntax and terminology is critical when
communicating with others. Patience is critical.

<p>

Email is the worst, so to assure you that I am in a cheery mood and willing to
assist, I will drown your inbox with smiley-face emoticons - nothing else seems
to work. It is extra difficult because of the BOFH persona folks generally
attribute to support groups like corp IT and production staff. BOFH is
hilarious, but it's an antipattern for treating your users, just like calling
them 'lusers'. People have been trained to think they are at fault when some
crappy piece of software they use misbehaves, and they have been trained to
feel like they are massively inconveniencing you when they ask for support that
you were hired to give. It's upsetting - I'm here to help.

<p>

I've also found the uncomfortable realization that my jobs are often not just
hacking on problems. Politics (and the falsehoods required) are an unavoidable
part of the job process.

<p>

On the life side, I got married to the greatest girl in the world and got two
dogs. Wendy and I had been together for almost six years before getting
married. Our first dog died suddenly of an autoimmune disease at age five, and
our current doggy is quite goofy and going happy at age two.

<p>

While at RIT, I learned to rollerblade, skateboard, and play ice hockey. I
still skateboard and would like to get back into hockey.

<p>

I also traveled a lot. I lived in Georgia, then New York, then California. I've
been to Dublin, Seattle, Washington DC, the Caribbean, Vegas, and New Orleans.
I started going with friends to Defcon and got involved with Hack or Halo at
Shmoocon. I also went to BarCamps in NYC, Rochester, and the Bay Area.

<p>

Dublin, Ireland and Seattle were for Google work trips. Dublin was awesome. My
trip coincided with Mashup Camp, where I met up with some <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/theater/archives/2007/11/mashup_camp_dublin.html">Yahoo
folks</a> on a after-event bar hop. Dublin's Temple Bar district is good fun
and reminded me a bit of Bourbon Street in New Orleans with all its
shenanigans. Seattle was more business and less social, only stopping in at <a
href="http://www.burgermaster.biz/">Burger Master</a> for some good burgers
while in town.

<p>

<img src="/images/hackday-small.png" style="float: right">

BarCamps were awesome everywhere. The first one I went to was NYC in 2006,
where a <a href="http://ejohn.org/">fellow CSHer</a> demoed the first version
of jQuery; I remember staying up until almost 4AM at CollegeHumor's offices
(the barcamp location, I think?) hacking with it.

<p>

There were also Yahoo! Hack Days; I went to both of the ones held here in the
Bay Area. The <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/yahoo-hackday-06-part1.html">first
hack day</a> had me hacking up del.icio.us and also writing <a
href="/projects/keynav">keynav</a> (a project still maintained and used!). My
del.icio.us hack resulted in a Wall Street Journal "Marketing" section
front-page column, which was one of the most awesome things ever (<a
href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06277/727314-96.stm">article also viewable
here</a>). I'd never been in any newspaper before.

<p>

Two years later, Yahoo! held another open hack day where I wrote <a
href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/jordansissel/snackupon">SnackUpon</a>, which got
coverage on <a
href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2008/09/snackupon_creates_an_rss_feed_tailored_to_your_tastes-2/">lifehacker</a>
and a few other sites. These events weren't my first 12-hour hackathons. At
RIT, CSH ran yearly team coding competitions sponsored by Red Bull and Bawls;
my team won two years.

<p>

These hackathons repeatedly highlight that my productivity spikes after
midnight. I've been fortunate to have jobs that understand this and don't
require me to be at the office every day at 9AM.

<p>

Wrapping up a decade that had lots of travel, learning, hacking, and networking
(with people) on and offline, it doesn't seem likely the trend of travel,
learning, hacking, and networking is showing any signs of downturn.
