I've been doing various Xlib projects off and on for a few years, but none of
them have been window manager projects because I was using a WM that pleased
me: Ion. Many years later, after following ion from ion 1, 2, and now 3, the
author decided to apply some user unfriendly licensing terms to newer releases
of ion-3. This license change combined with the author's efforts to require
distributions to comply with this license has resulted in most platforms
dropping the ion-3 package from its distribution because nobody wants to deal
with assholes.

<p>

I'm not going to get into a discussion about my opinions about the license.
Just know that it inconveniences me, and if you know me, you know that I tend
to solve problems of inconvenience with new software tools. That means I need a
new window manager.

<p>

I've tested other window managers, but none fit me as well as ion did.

<p>

A few weeks ago I started on a window manager project tentatively called tsawm
which implements features I like in ion but without the angry-author problems
ion has. I started working on it initially in C, since that's where I use xlib,
but C has some drawbacks. A nontrivial percentage of what I perceive to be
window manager behavior is basically managing some heirarchy of data (frames,
client windows, titles, some state). I started looking at Perl's X11::Protocol
and Python's xlib module. Python's xlib module is pretty neat, in that it's a
pure-python implementation of the X11 protocol.

<p>

Somewhat arbitrarily, I started prototyping to see if writing a window manager
in python was possible. Yes, it is. So that's where I'm at today.

<p>

I've mostly been hacking things together while learning more about window
managing in X, but what I have so far is promising: <a

<p>

It's not pretty, but finishing this will help me get past the drama and
problems that ion and its author bring. Sorry tuomov, I still love ion, but any
licenses that keep me (directly or indirectly) from getting shit done aren't
acceptable.
