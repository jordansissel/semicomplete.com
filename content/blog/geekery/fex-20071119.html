Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/fex">fex project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p>

Changelist:
<pre>
20071119 -
  - Add nongreedy tokenizer. Same semantics of strtok_r(), but doesn't skip
    empty tokens.
  - Renamed tokenizer to split, since really that's what it was doing.
  - You can invoke the nongreedy tokenizer by using '?' as the first character
    of a {} set:
     args: :{?4,6}
     input: one:::four::six
     output: four:six
</pre>
