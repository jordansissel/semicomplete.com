I noticed that my tabsearch extension wasn't working properly after installing Firefox 3.0b5. A quick read of 
<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Updating_extensions_for_Firefox_3">
this document</a> helped me figure out what was wrong. I also wasn't specifying the
right content location in my chrome.manifest, which somehow worked fine in
firefox 2 despite not being correct. Maybe the previous extension release was a
custom built one that didn't use the make system I have now, either way, it's
all fixed.

Head on over to the <a href="/projects/firefox-tabsearch">firefox tabsearch project page</a> and download it.

Additionally, I've noticed that Firefox 3.0b5 doesn't seem to render this site
correctly. Seems like it's ignoring my CSS of "pre { overflow: auto; }" which
makes pre tags scroll if they become too wide. I'm willing to accept that I may
be doing something incorrect (that has historically worked fine) - I'd much
rather have the site render as intended. I'll look into it later.
