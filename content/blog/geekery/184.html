I spent the last two days working out the prototyping ideas for the new moused.
So far I've got a decent plugin framework with two plugins written currently.
I've been using this new moused since yesterday with much success.
<p/>

moused.c is 280 lines (will likely be less when finished)<br>
the sysmouse module is 160 lines and supports ums(4) and psm(4) mice<br/>
<br/>

The old moused.c was over 3000 lines long. The existing psm(4) is well over 3000
lines. I don't anticipate my moused ever being over 300 lines of code. The
plugins will be doing the meat of the work. I'm hoping to make the plugin
api good enough so that plugins will only have to know how to talk to their
specific hardware and let moused worry about talking to sysmouse(4).
<p/>

Right now there is a potential for writing some filter modules becuase of the
way the plugin api is designed. Filters would be used for such things as
emulate-3-button and virtual scrolling (-3 and -V respectively). I already have
a filter written for virtual scrolling. Compared to the hackery I had to throw
into the old moused to get virtual scrolling working, this was an absolute
breeze to write. It is simply a function called 'filter' that understands what
virtual scrolling is and when to do it. Filter is called before any updates are
pushed to sysmouse.
<p/>

The next big job is going to be stripping psm(4) of it's bloat and making it an
almost a pass-through device. The non-standard mice it supports currently
(synaptics, etc) will be supported through plugins in the new moused.
<p/>

If you're interested in helping me test this, let me know.
