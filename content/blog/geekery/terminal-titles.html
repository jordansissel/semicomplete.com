<a href="http://dinomite.net/2009/using-the-shell-right/">Drew Stephens</a>
spent some time on Christmas to share some of his shell configuration,
including different ways he uses prompts and colors.

<p>

I'll start with prompts.

<p>

I use zsh. My prompt looks like this:

<pre>
# Plain
snack(~) % 

# Long directory is truncated at the left
snack(...jects/grok/ruby/test/general) % 

# I get exit status only if it is nonzero:
snack(~) % true
snack(~) % false
snack(~) !1! % 

# if I am root, and using zsh, the '%' becomes '#'
snack(~) # 
</pre>

This is all achieved with the following PS1 in zsh:
<pre>
PS1='%m(%35&lt;...&lt;%~) %(?..!%?! )%# '
</pre>

We have configurable prompts to give us all kinds of information, why? It's a
place to gather context from. I include host, directory, exit status, and an
"am i root" flag.

<p>

PS1 isn't the only place you can store useful state. I like to have similar
information in my terminal's titlebar, too.  I use screen and xterm, and both
can be fed some delicious data.

<p>

I use this in my .screenrc, which tells screen to have some default status
format and tells screen how to change xterm's title. I have it include the
screen window number (%n), hostname (%h), and terminal title (%t):

<pre>
hardstatus string "[%n] %h - %t"
termcapinfo xterm 'hs:ts=\E]2;:fs=\007:ds=\E]2;screen (not title yet)\007'
windowlist title "Num Name%=Location Flags"
windowlist string "%03n %t%=%h %f"
</pre>

I also use this bit of .vimrc, which tells vim what kind of title I want, and
if the $TERM is screen, how to tell screen about it.

<pre>
" Set title string and push it to xterm/screen window title
set titlestring=vim\ %&lt;%F%(\ %)%m%h%w%=%l/%L-%P
set titlelen=70
if &term == "screen"
  set t_ts=^[k
  set t_fs=^[\
endif
if &term == "screen" || &term == "xterm" 
  set title
endif
</pre>

And then use <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/files/blogposts/20091227/zsh-titles">this bit
of my zshrc</a>.

<p>

All of these combined together make for some pretty good terminal and screen
titles. The functions preexec, precmd, and title, mentioned below, come from
the above zshrc link.

<p>

The preexec function in my zshrc runs before each command execution and allows
me to change the terminal title to reflect the command I am running. It also
supports resumed execution of a process: if you run 'cat', then hit ^Z, then
type 'fg', the title will correctly be set to 'cat' again. 

<p>

The precmd function runs before each prompt. Rather than cluttering up $PS1
with byte strings to set the title, I just make precmd set the title to 'zsh -
$PWD'.

<p>

The title function takes care of any necessary escaping and also does nice
things like string truncation if it is too long (similar to how my $PS1 is
configured).

<p>

I only use vim's titlestring options because it gives me some better context on
what I am doing in vim at the time, mainly because vim allows you to edit
multiple files at once.

<p>

Here's an example of a few screen windows in a single screen session when
viewed in the windowlist:

<center><img src="/files/blogposts/20091227/screen-titles.png"></center>

The first 3 columns are most meaningful: number, name, and location. Note that
each location correctly identifies the host that shell is using. My zshrc
'title' function manages setting the name and the location.

<p>

The same data listed above is combined into the actual terminal's title. Window
2 above would have this title in xterm: 

<pre>[2] jls - zsh - /home/jsissel</pre>

<p>

I mentioned above that I use screen and xterm together. I do this for
everything using <a
href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/tools/run-xterm.sh">run-xterm.sh</a>.
This script will run screen in an xterm with a randomly chosen, dark color
background. I find the dark-random color selection quite a nice deviation from
the solid-black my desktop used to bear. Here's what it looks like if I run a
20+ xterms on a blank desktop:
