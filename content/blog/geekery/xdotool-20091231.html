A new release of xdotool is available.

This release has only minor changes based on changes needed to help Debian and
other folks package this. Speaking of which: thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor and
Wen-Yen Chuang for helping maintain the Debian packages for xdotool and keynav
and for working with me on these changes.

<p/>

Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool project page</a> and
download the new version.
