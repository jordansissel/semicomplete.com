Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool project page</a> and
download the new version. This is the first version being served totally from
googlecode, let me know if you have problems.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20080521:
  * Import patches from keynav's xdotool branch (From Lukas Mai) which make
    xdotool compile happily when building with -Wall and -pedantic (and others)
  * Finally convert to using Window type for (hopefully) everything instead of
    incorrectly typecasting Window to int sometimes.
  * Confirmed that the one (but mostly useless) test passes.
</pre>
