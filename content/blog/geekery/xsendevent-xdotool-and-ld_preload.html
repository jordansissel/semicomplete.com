As far as feature requests come, for xdotool, one of the more common ones is to
have the ability to send key or mouse events to a specific window, not just the
active one. XTEST (what xdotool uses for key/mouse currently) doesn't let you
specify a window to send events. XSendEvent(3) lets you send hand-crafted
events to a specific window, but most applications ignore these sent events.

<p>

The XEvent struct has a member 'send_event' which is true if the event came
from an XSendEvent call and false otherwise. Programs like firefox and xterm
(by default) ignore many events that have 'send_event' set to true.

<p>

Enter LD_PRELOAD.

<p>

Writing a custom shared library that overrides the default XNextEvent and
XPeekEvent functions allows us to force 'send_event' to always be false, so an
application with this library loaded will happily handle keyboard/mouse events
generated with XSendEvent. I already have a helpful project that lets me write such a shared library: liboverride.

<p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;

void hack_send_event(XEvent *ev) {
  switch (ev->type) {
    case KeyPress: case KeyRelease: case ButtonPress: case ButtonRelease:
      ev->xany.send_event = False;
      break;
  }
}

override(`XNextEvent', `
  {
    real_func(display, event_return);
    hack_send_event(event_return);
    return;
  }
')
</pre>

This small bit of liboverride code will give me a shared library I can preload
with LD_PRELOAD. Doing so will ensure that send_event is false for any key or
mouse button events.

<p>

Works well. Now that we have a reliable way to allow XSendEvent I think it's
worth putting this into xdotool.
