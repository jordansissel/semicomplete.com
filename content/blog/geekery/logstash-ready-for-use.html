I've talked for a while about logging problems. Parsing, storing, searching, reacting.

<p>

Today is the first release of logstash.

<p>

What is logstash? Free and open source log/event management and search. It's
designed to scale and help you more easily manage your logs and provides you a
great way to search them for debugging, postmortems, and other analysis.
