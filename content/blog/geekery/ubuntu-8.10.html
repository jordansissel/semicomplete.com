Upgraded my workstation to ubuntu 8.10 without much stress. Horray.

<p>

Feels like firefox is running slower now, but that might just be perceived
slowness or network crappiness. Still, I ran top(1) and saw some new
'chipcardd4' process waking up every few seconds and bursting cpu. It wasn't
doing enough to cause problems, but I'd never seen it before. Checking strace
showed it in a loop sleeping for 750ms, twice, then reading through
/sys/devices/. Doing "sudo ./libchipcard-tools stop" made it go away.

<p>

Doesn't linux have inotify so programs don't have to do sleepy-loops checking
the filesystem?
