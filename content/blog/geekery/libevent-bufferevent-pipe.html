From the libevent documentation:

<blockquote>
A new bufferevent is created by bufferevent_new().  The parameter fd specifies
the file descriptor from which data is read and written to.  This file descrip-
tor is not allowed to be a pipe(2).
</blockquote>

It says it's not allowed to be a pipe, but it works just fine in Linux with
epoll, poll, and select.

<p>

I'm certain I've just unleashed some evil demons that'll make my code crash in
unexpectedly wonderful ways as a result... ;)
