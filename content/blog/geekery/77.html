So until now I never knew how to pipe things into my shell scripts - I'm smacking myself on the head now for not having figured this out sooner.<p>

In unix, the standard file descriptors <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and <code>stderr</code> are numbered
0, 1, and 2, respectively. I've always done descriptor redirection, such as:<p>
<pre>grep ^Poop myfile.txt 2>&1 > /dev/null</pre>
<br>
This will redirect <code>stderr</code> (fd #2) to <code>stdout</code> (fd #1). <code>stdout</code> is then redirected to <code>/dev/null</code>.
<p>
What I never bothered trying was redirecting <code>stdin</code>. (fd #0). Let's take a look at this simple script:<p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

echo "Printing output:"
sed -e 's/^./Output: &/' <&0 
</pre>
<br>

Note the <code><&0</code> - this will use our <code>stdin</code> as the <code>stin</code> for sed.<br>
Now, let's try running it:<br>
<code>ls | ./myscript</code>
<p>

The output is just how I want:<br>
<pre>
whack(~/bin) [590] > /bin/ls | sh myls.sh
Printing output:
Output: Mrandom
Output: fix
Output: hostlist
Output: intarweb
Output: logtail
Output: malbums
Output: mclear
Output: minfo
Output: myls.sh
</pre>
