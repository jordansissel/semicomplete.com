Tonight I played with Mozilla Rhino and a few other toys.

<p>

Serving webpages dynamically with javascript on the server-side just feels
strange. Ignoring the strange sensation in my brain, the concept of server-side
javascript is a good one.

<p>

Client-side web scripting is javascript. Server-side is typically not. This
means input validation and other common code has to be written in two different
languages. This leads to bugs. One language on both ends lets you share lots of
code trivially. Neat.
