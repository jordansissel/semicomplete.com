Perl grok was great. I learned a lot about how far beyond normal I could take
regular expressions. I ported much of perl grok to C++ using Boost Xpressive, but
Boost has a lot of baggage with it. I didn't like the feel of Xpressive, Boost
is huge, compiling takes forever and a day (thanks C++ Templates!), and
binaries are almost guaranteed to be 1meg or more.
<p>

That said, I think I might be reinventing the wheel again by trying to see what
grok in C with libpcre feels like.

Sample code line:

<pre>
  re = pcre_compile("([0-9]+)(?C1)", 0, &errptr, &erroffset, NULL);
</pre>

<i>(?C1)</i> is PCRE-syntax for "call callback #1" - the callback I wrote
converts the last capture into a number and only succeeds if the value is
greater than 5. It'll succeed once that precondition passes:

<pre>
% ./a.out "foo 2 4 6 8"     
Trying: 2
Trying: 4
Trying: 6
Found: 6
</pre>

All with a single regular expression + callouts. This feature (called callouts
by PCRE) is what allows me (and you) to use predicates in grok. PCRE passes the
first test.

<p>

A few hours later, I had pattern injection working (Turning %FOO% into it's
regular expression) and could parse logs with ease.

<p>

I couldn't help pitting the boost and pcre versions against eachother, even
though the feature set isn't the same, yet. pcregrok processed 37000lines/sec
of apachelog (the most complex regexp I have), versus 6200/sec from c++/boost
grok.
