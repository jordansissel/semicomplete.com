tic is almost ready for the real world, I added a *ton* of features to it today/yesterday (eh, I'm still awake and it's 8am...)<p>

- Tab completion<br>
- Aliases<br>
- Logging<br>
- Timestamps<br>
- Customizable output<p>

It also supports minimal line editing. That is, you can use the arrow keys to
cursor around within the input line and edit as you please.
