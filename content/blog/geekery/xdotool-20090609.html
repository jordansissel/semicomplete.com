Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20090609:
  * Add '--delay <delay_in_ms>' to xdotool type. Sets the delay between keys.
  * Add '--window <windowid>' to xdotool type, key, keyup, and keydown.
    This feature (key events with --window <windowid>) only works if the
    application does not reject X events that have 'send_event' set to true.

    Special notes:
    * Firefox appears to ignore all input when it does not have focus.
    * xterm ignores sendevent by default, ctrl+leftclick menu will let you
      enable it.
    * gnome-terminal appears to accept send_event input by default
</pre>
