<p>

<p>

Major changes:
<ul>
  <li> xdotool getmouselocation now supports --shell for outputting something you can simply eval into your shell </li>
  <li> Added 'sync' support to several commands. The --sync flag, if supported,
  will wait until the requested operation has completed before exiting.</li>
  <li> Added --polar (polar coordinate) support to mousemove </li>
  <li> Fixed some keymap bugs </li>
</ul>

<p>

Changelist since previous announcement:
<pre>
2.20100524.*:
  - Add --sync flag to many commands. This flag will make any supporting command
    block until the operation completes. For example, a 'windowmove --sync' will
    only exit once the window has moved. Commands supported:
    * windowactivate
    * windowfocus
    * windowmap
    * windowmove
    * windowunmap
  - Fix http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=21
    Multiple keyboard layouts are now supported better. Added unit tests
    to ensure consistency in typing across releases.
  - Added polar coordinate support to mouse movement. 'mousemove' and
    'mousemove_relative' support this. Flag is --polar. 'x' becomes angle (degrees)
    and 'y' becomes distance. The default origin is screen center. If you specify
    a window (to mousemove) then the origin is the center of that window.
    Requested by Paul S on the xdotool-users mailing list.
  - internal: Reworked testing to be less flakey
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=30
  - internal: split commands into one per C file
  - API changes that required a version bump.
    * xdo_keysequence and friends now take a delay.
  - New libxdo functions:
    * xdo_window_wait_for_map_state
    * xdo_window_wait_for_active
    * xdo_get_window_location
    * xdo_window_wait_for_focus


1.20100415.*:
  - Add support for searching classnames (not just class)
  - Support switched xkbmaps. We do this by checking if the keycode found for a keysym
    has that keysym as the first or second (normal or with shift-key) mapping, if not
    we pretend we didn't find it and request it be bound as if the keysym wasn't mapped
    to any key.

    This is a hack to avoid knowing what other modifiers are required to type
    keysyms mapped at indexes 2 or beyond (0 is normal, 1 is shift, 2 and beyond
    are unknown).
    Verified fixes this: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=13
    Should fix some of this: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=21
  - Add --shell flag to getmouselocation. This will output data you can safely
    eval in your shell.
  - Add platform detection for Darwin when building.
    Should fix: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=28

1.20100325.*:
  - Fix bug in search where --name wasn't working. Test written to cover this.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=25

1.20100318.*:
  - Bug fixes only this release
  - Rewrote tests to use ruby and will now test against Xvfb and Xephyr using:
    no window manager, openbox, and then gnome.
  - Fix build problems on Arch linux (or gentoo?)
    Fixes: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=20
  - Fix searching for only visible windows.
    Fixes: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=22
  - Fix xdotool search flags: --title, --name, --class
  - Add include for keysym.h to fix compile errors reported on the mailing
    list.
