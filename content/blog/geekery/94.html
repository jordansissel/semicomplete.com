Yeah, so having just figured this out now (I'm sure it's in a manpage somewhere) -<br>
You can open file descriptors at will by doing:<br>
<br>
<pre>
exec 3> file_output
</pre>
<br>
The 3 here is the number of the file descriptor, and can be any number really. What this lets you do now is write to that file descriptor:<br>
<br>
<pre>
echo "Hello there" >&3
</pre>
<br>
Now, if you look at the contents of <code>file_output</code> you'll see that it contains "Hello there" - neat?<p>

To close a file descriptor do this:<br>
<pre>
exec 3>&-
</pre>
<br>
again, where 3 is the number of the file descriptor you want to close.
