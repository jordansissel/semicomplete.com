Whoever wrote the tsearch/tfind/tdelete/twalk functions for libc clearly
stopped thinking about how it would be used. The only way I can see to iterate
the tree is to use twalk, which doesn't let you pass any extra arguments to
your provided action method.

<p>

This sucks if, for example, you wanted to get a list of all entries in the tree in a threadsafe or multiplicity-safe way.

<p>

Some workarounds include:
<ul>
  <li> Every time you insert, add the same structure to an array. </li>
  <li> Use something that supports sane iteration (bdb, for example). </li>
</ul>

I looked into using bdb for some things, but the tree I wanted to iterate over
most was a structure that held, among other things, a function pointer.
Function pointers are magical and special and are held in a place in memory you
can't simply make a copy of. If you try to store a function pointer in an
in-memory BDB database, the value that comes out of your query will be
different than the function pointer.

<p>

<a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/codesamples/bdb-functionpointer-test.c">This bdb code sample</a> attempts to store a function pointer in bdb. The output is:

<pre>
stored: 607a70
actual: 4005e8
</pre>

The value changed because copying a function pointer doesn't work.

<p>

There's a workaround here that might be useful - dlopen(). Any functions I want
to store in bdb, I would store by string name and fetch the function pointer
with dlsym().

<p>

<a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/codesamples/dlopen_self.c">This
dlopen example</a> shows how to dlopen yourself and fetch a function by string
name.

<p>

Fun with pointers.
