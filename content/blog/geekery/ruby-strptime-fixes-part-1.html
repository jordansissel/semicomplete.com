A project I'm working on has some odd slowness about it. Using ruby-prof, I
found that String#scan was consuming most of the time, but ruby-prof didn't
tell me where it was coming from. A quick hack that replaced String#scan with
my own method showed who was calling it, DateTime.strptime -

<pre>
class String
  def scan(*args)
    raise
  end
end
</pre>

I tried using the ruby debugger to break on String#scan, but it didn't seem to
work. PEBCAK, probably, which is why I used the solution above to just toss an
exception when that function was called.

<p>

Back at the point, DateTime.strptime is slow. Looking at the underlying code
shows you why: <a
href="http://google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en&sa=N&cd=3&ct=rc#fKFrbe9QqQ4/lib/ruby/1.9/date/format.rb&q=date/format.rb%20lang:ruby&l=393">date/format.rb
- the _strptime_i method</a>.

<p>

Lots of string shuffling, regular expressions to match field specifiers (%d,
etc), string modification with more regexps, etc. The code is pretty easy to
read, but it's still doing a lot of work it doesn't need to be doing. Luckily,
libc comes with a method for parsing times in the same way: strptime.

<p>

So, I started working on an extension to the Time class that invokes libc's
strptime and returns a Time instance: <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/source/browse/ruby-ctime">ruby-ctime</a>. The usage is simple once you have the module:

<pre>
require "CTime"

puts Time.strptime("%Y", "2009")
# outputs 'Wed Jan 00 00:00:00 +0000 2009'
</pre>

The one major holdback from strptime is that there's no wide support for
timezones. Format strings like %Z and %z work with strftime, but generally are
unsupported by strptime; exceptions that do support %z are glibc, and freebsd
appears to support both %Z and %z. Nothing reliably cross-platform.  This is a
historical problem due to the fact that the 'struct tm' structure has no
timezone field (glibc and the bsds add 'long tm_gmtoff' to support timezones).

<p>

This means we'll have to correct for this by extending strptime to support it,
but I'm not there yet.

<p>

Anyway, short benchmarking for features supported by both libc strptime and
DateTime strptime shows libc a massive winner:

<pre>
snack(~/projects/ruby-ctime) % ruby test.rb
Iterations: 10000
datetime: 7.680928 (1301.92601727291/sec)
my_strptime: 0.126583 (78999.5497025667/sec)
</pre>

A 60x speedup using the new C code vs DateTime.strptime. This is a great start,
but we still need timezone support. I need to hack timezone support into this,
which probably means I'll start with glibc's strptime implementation.
