My todo list has had "grok - magical 'pattern finder' thing" since May of this
year. I added it after I wrote up some thoughts on <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/sequencing-and-searching-strings">pattern matching, string
sequencing, and automation</a>.

<p>

I spent many hours on that problem tonight.

<p>

Initially, I wrote a python script which would compare each line in a file
against every other line in the file. Using difflib and string split, I could
figure out what words were changed between two lines. If the lines were
similar, I could compute the difference and replace the differences with a
token placeholder, such as "WORD".

<p>
<a href="/files/blogposts/20070901/distance_sort.py">Download this python script</a>

<p>

Here's a sample output of the tool where it compares one line against another, computes the difference and makes a new string that will match both lines:
<pre>
0.91: error: PAM: authentication error for illegal user karinebeers
    : error: PAM: authentication error for illegal user leshana
  ==> error: PAM: authentication error for illegal user %WORD%
</pre>

This script is fairly primitive in execution. It only compares whole tokens,
which are delimited by space. This was good, but not enough. It doesn't know
about compound patterns such as quoted strings, or complex patterns such as
those matching an IP address or a file path.

<p>

How do we consider complex patterns like hostnames and quoted strings? Turns
out, most of the pattern matching wizardry is in grok. Grok knows about named
patterns, and we can abuse this to use grok in a different way - instead of
parsing text, we're going to use it to turn input text into a grok pattern.

<p>

Example:
<pre>
% echo '/foo/bar/baz "foo bar baz" hello ther 1234 www.google.com' \
| perl grok -F 
%UNIXPATH% %QS% hello ther 1234 %IPORHOST%
</pre>

What did it do?
<pre>
input:  /foo/bar/baz "foo bar baz" hello ther 1234 www.google.com
output: %UNIXPATH%   %QS%          hello ther 1234 %IPORHOST%
</pre>

Using a new hack on top of grok, we can now turn an unknown plaintext input
into a pattern that is reusable and human-meaningful. This is totally awesome.

<p>

This hack only considers complex tokens for simplicity's sake; that is, tokens
only containing letters and numbers are ignored. Why? Is 'foo1234' a word or a
hostname?  Is 1997 a number or a year? Grok allows you to make these
distinctions, but I skip simple tokens so I don't have to programatically
weight random patterns. Note the above example, where '1234' was not replaced
with '%NUMBER%' or something similar.

<p>

So, I run this new grok hack on my /var/log/messages file. Here's a sampling of
output from grok:

<pre>
# grok -F < /var/log/messages
%SYSLOGBASE% logfile turned over due to size>100K
%SYSLOGBASE% kernel time sync enabled 6001
%SYSLOGBASE% error: PAM: authentication error for testuser from %IPORHOST%
%SYSLOGBASE% Limiting closed port RST response from 380 to 200 packets/sec
%SYSLOGBASE% error: PAM: authentication error for admin from %IPORHOST%
%SYSLOGBASE% error: PAM: authentication error for pants from %IPORHOST%
%SYSLOGBASE% kernel time sync enabled 6001
%SYSLOGBASE% kernel time sync enabled 2001
</pre>

This is pretty close to a reusable pattern that captures all the changing data.
You'll notice there are commonalities among certain lines such as the
'authentication error' lines where only the username is different. Let's run
the 'authentication error' lines only through the python script and see what
happens:

<pre>
# messages.patterns contains the output of 'grok -F'
% grep 'authentication error' messages.patterns > testinput
% python distance_sort.py  testinput | sort | uniq
%SYSLOGBASE% error: PAM: authentication error for %WORD% from %IPORHOST%
%SYSLOGBASE% error: PAM: authentication error for illegal user %WORD% from %IPORHOST%
</pre>

Wow, that's <i>exactly</i> what I wanted out of this process. Now we have some
useful patterns, generated with almost zero effort. Let's apply this to our log
file and see what we can get. How about counting, by user, failed login
attempts?

<pre>
pattern="%SYSLOGBASE% error: PAM: authentication error for %WORD% from %IPORHOST%"
./grok -m "$pattern" -r "%WORD%" < messages \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -5
   5 backup
   9 angel
  10 pgsql
  12 mail
  17 ident
</pre>

<h4> So what have we really accomplished? </h4>

You can take any log file and run it through this process. The output of this
process is a set of patterns you can use to query data in that log file (and
others like it). The real power here is not that patterns are generated, it's
that named, queryable patterns are generated. That's awesome.
