<i> This is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/keynav-users/browse_thread/thread/aff60714fb1f3556">the same post</a> I made to the keynav-users mailing list</i>

<p>

I just finished working on the xinerama portion of multi-screen
support for keynav.

<p>

If someone is interested, I could use some help testing. It's working
for me, and there are a few odd behaviors that I'm not sure are the
best. Let me know if you test it.

<p>

No new official release yet, but if you want to test, svn can be
fetched with: <br>
svn checkout http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/keynav 

<pre>
- Include support for multiple screens.
  * When 'start' happens, the region will be the size of the current display
    (wherever the mouse is)
  * Moving the region outside of the current display will move it to the next
    display (right or left). This currently only works with Xinerama.
  * History works as expected (move to the right display, history-back goes to
    the previous display, etc)
  * When multiple Screen (non-xinerama) are found, XGrabKey on all root windows.
  * Screens are sorted, if possible, from left-to-right based on x-coordinate
    origin. This unfortuntely means, for now, only left-to-right monitor
    configurations are known to be supported.
