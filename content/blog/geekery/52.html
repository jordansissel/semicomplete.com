Found a few issues with the latest changes I made to my ksh prompt...<p>

<pre>
[ -w "/" ] && Z="#" || Z=">"; export Z
PROMPT='$(A=$?; /bin/echo -n $HOST"("`/bin/pwd | /usr/bin/sed -Ee "s,(/usr)?$HOME,~,"`") [!] "$([ $A -ne 0 ] && /bin/echo -n "!!${A}!! ")$Z" " )'
XTERM=
case $TERM in
  aterm|xterm|dtterm)
    XTERM='$(echo -n "\033]2;'${PROMPT%%$Z*}')\007" 1>&2)'
    ;;
esac 
export PS1=$XTERM$PROMPT
</pre>

<p>

Keep in mind that <code>PROMPT</code> is very long...<br>
Previously, it didn't report exit codes due to kludges that made <code>$?</code> change to <code>0</code> due to the exit status of some of the crap that runs inside the prompt.<p>

Huzzah.
However, on a sad note I'll point out the obnoxious length of <code>PS1</code> now...<br>
