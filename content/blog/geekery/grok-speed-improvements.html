The benchmark for testing speed improvements was to process 3000 lines for
'%SYSLOGBASE .*? %IPORHOST%'. Profiler was Devel::Profile.

Before:
<pre>
time running program:  11.9738  (85.07%)
number of calls:       409362

<pre>

</pre>

Primary changes were mostly to pregenerate a few regular expressions.
Previously, I was generating the same regex every time filter() or
meta2string() was being called. These small changes gave grok a serious boost
in speed: what was taking 12 seconds now takes 2.5 seconds.

<p>

One example of a simple optimization is this:

<pre>
before: my $re = join("|", map { qr/(?:$_)/ } keys(%$filters));
after:  our $re ||= join("|", map { qr/(?:$_)/ } keys(%$filters));
</pre>

This may decrease readability, but it only sets $re once no matter how many
times that line of code is executed. This line of code change was in the
filter() function. Just doing this one simple change reduced the runtime of
each filter() call by 97%; which reduces its runtime to something trivially
small by comparison.

<p>

At this point, this is where I was very happy to have written tests for grok.
To verify that grok still behaved properly after making these speed
improvements, I just ran the tests suite. It passed, giving me some confidence
in the stability of the changes.
