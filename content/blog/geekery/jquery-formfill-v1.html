It's always nice when websites you commonly visit remember things about you, or
atleast give the perception that they remember things about you.

<p>

The Pyblosxom comment plugin doesn't autofill the form. That's too bad. I don't
really want to dig into the python code to do any cookie-setting on submission,
becuase I have never looked at the code and thusly am unfamiliar with the
effort required for such a change. Luckily, we can use javascript to store data
in cookies too!

<p>

I love jQuery, so that's what I'll use for this little hack. On the comments page, I add the following javascript:

<pre>
   var uname = "u.name";
   var uemail = "u.email";
   var usite = "u.site";

   function saveCommentInformation() {
      // Save user information from the form!
      createCookie(uname, $("input[@name='author']").val());
      createCookie(uemail, $("input[@name='email']").val());
      createCookie(usite, $("input[@name='url']").val());
   }

   function initCommentForm() {
      // Autofill user information if available
      $("input[@name='author']").val(readCookie(uname));
      $("input[@name='email']").val(readCookie(uemail));
      $("input[@name='url']").val(readCookie(usite));

      // Save comment information when form is submitted
      $("form[@name='comments_form']").submit(saveCommentInformation);
   }

   $(document).ready(initCommentForm);
</pre>

That's all we need. Whenever someone submits, we will store useful information in a cookie. Whenever that person comes back, we'll pull the data out of the cookie and put it back in the form. User Experience is happier, atleast as far as I am concerned (as a user).

<p>

If you are wondering about the 'readCookie' and 'createCookie' functions, you
can find them on quirksmode.org: <p>
