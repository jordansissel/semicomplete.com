I've been working recently on dynamic, simple graphing. Systems like Cacti
provide useful interfaces, but getting data into it is a pain in the ass.

<p>

You have 1500 machines you want in cacti. How do you do it? 

<p>

My take is that you shouldn't ever need to preregister data types or data
sources. Have a system that you simply throw data at, and it stores it so you
can get a graph of it later. All I need to do, to graph new data, is simply
write a script that produces that data and sends it to the collector. 

<p>

The collector is a python cgi script that frontends to rrdtool. It takes all cgi paramters and stores the values with a few exceptions:
<ul>
  <li> machine=XX - Spoof machine to store data for. If not given, defaults to
  REMOTE_ADDR. Useful if you need to proxy data through another machine, or are
  reporting data about another machine you are probing.</li>
  <li> timestamp=XX - Override default timestamp ("now"). </li>
</ul>

Everything else gets stored like this: /dataroot/&lt;machine&gt;/&lt;variable&gt;.rrd

<p>

Example:
<pre>
kenya(/mnt/rrds/129.21.60.26) % ls
C_bytes_per_page.rrd                            C_pages_inactive.rrd
C_cpu_context_switches.rrd                      C_rfork_calls.rrd
... etc ...
</pre>

All of those rrds are created by simply throwing data at the python cgi script.
The source of the data is a script that runs 'vmstat -s' and turns it into
key-value pairs.

<p>

Why are the files prefixed with "C_" ? The data I am feeding in comes from counters, and therefore should be stored as counter datatypes in rrdtool. The 'C_' prefix is a hint that if the variable needs an rrd created for it, that the DS type should be COUNTER. The default without this prefix is GAUGE.

<p>

<p>

Feel free to <a href="/scripts/statpoll.sh">view the vmstat -s poll script </a> to get a better idea of what this does. I also have another script that will do some <a href="/scripts/freebsd-netstat.sh">scraping on 'netstat -s' in freebsd</a> (probably works in linux too).

<p>

vmstat -s looks like this:
<pre>
456846233 cpu context switches
3220655757 device interrupts
 17964606 software interrupts
  ... etc ...
</pre>

It's trivial to turn this into key-value pairs. If this were Cacti (or similar
system) I would have to go through every line of vmstat -s and create a new
data type/source/thing for each one, then create one per host. Screw that. Keep
in mind my experience with Cacti is pretty small - I saw I had to register data
sources and graphs and such manually and left it alone after that.

<p>

Anyway, back at the problem. Now how do I graph it? The interface isn't the best, but we use a cgi script again:

<p>

Show me all the machines with 'C_system_calls' graphed over the past 15 minutes:
<br>
graph.py?machines=129.21.60.1,&lt;...&gt;,129.21.60.26&keys=C_system_calls&start=-15min

<p>

<p>

This kind of system has the feature that you never need to explicitly define
data input variables or data input sources - All you need is to hack together a
script that can pump out key-value pairs. No documentation to read. No time
consumed registering 500 new servers in your graph system.
