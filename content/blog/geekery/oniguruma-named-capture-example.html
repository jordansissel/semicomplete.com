For whatever reason, I decided to play with oniguruma tonight (a newish regular
expression library). I'm considering an effort to port some of grok's
functionality to C or C++ for speed reasons. Doing it in C++ would require me
to re-learn C++.

<p>

The docs are pretty complete, but not very helpful with respect to examples. I
wasn't able to find very many useful examples on google, but the API docs are
quite good. What wasn't answered by the docs  was answered by reading header
files. Excellent.

<p>

The result of this adventure is this:

<pre>
# regex: ^(?&lt;test&gt;.*?)( (?&lt;word2&gt;.*))?$
# input: "hello there"

% gcc -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lonig oniguruma_named_captures.c
% ./a.out "hello there"
word2 = there
test = hello
% ./a.out "foobarbazfizz"
word2 = 
test = foobarbazfizz
</pre>
