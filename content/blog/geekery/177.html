Long-story-short: I wanted a web-based presentation system that was easy and
fast. It took me a few hours to get it finished, but it's definatley at a 1.0
stage now. I'm going to add a few more cool features as time progresses, but
don't hold your breath.
<p/>
The project page has enough of a description of the project that I won't bother
discussing it here. Clicky!
