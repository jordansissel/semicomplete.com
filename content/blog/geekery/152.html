I got bored and wanted to see how my new site compares against other things.
These statistics are by no means thorough. The benchmarker I used is a 
very simple program called webbench. It simply sends request after
request at whatever you point it at. The statistics were done using 5
concurrent clients over 30 seconds (-c 5 -t 30).<p>

I think the results are pretty interesting.<p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td> http://www.google.com/ </td>
<td> 7126 pages/min </td>
</tr><tr>
<td> http://www.amazon.com/ </td>
<td> 8340 pages/min </td>
</tr><tr>
<td> http://www.csh.rit.edu/ </td>
<td> 3690 pages/min </td>

A factor of 10 difference with caching than without. Sheesh.
How easy is it to cache things in mason? Let me show you.

<pre>
<%init>
return if (!exists($m->request_args()->{'nocache'}) && 
		$m->cache_self(key => $m->comp("/lib/cachename"), expires_in => '30 minutes'));
&lt;/%init>
</pre>

Put that in the %init section of any component and poof, mason caches the
output of that component for 30 minutes (as specified). According to <a
href="http://www.masonhq.com/docs/manual/Request.html#item_cache_self">this
site</a>, you can cache the return values of components too, which makes it a
bit like Memoize in a way.<br>
The <code>/lib/cachename</code> componenet is a little dohicky I wrote up to 
automatically generate a key name to cache by:

<pre>
<%perl>
	my ($k,$v);
	my $args = scalar($m->caller_args(1));
	my $key = scalar($m->callers(1))->{"path"};
	$key .= ".$k=$v" while (($k,$v) = each(%$args));
	$key =~ s!s!_!g;
	return $key;
&lt;/%perl>
</pre>

This component generates a key in the form of "compname.foo=bar.baz=fizz" or
whatever. It takes the arguments passed to the component  and makes a unique
key out of it. This is so I can cache specific calls to each component (like
Memoize!) with specific arguments rather than simply caching only one output
and using that. This is slick.
