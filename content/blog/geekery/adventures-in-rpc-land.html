I wanted to play with Facebook's Thrift RPC tool tonight, but it doesn't seem
happy on freebsd. It fails somewhere in ./configure and I have no patience to
go swimming through automake/autoconf code to solve it. I'll just assume Thrift
was designed in a linux-centric manner and that it's a waste of my time trying
to fix something I may not even need.

<p>

So, I moved on and am going to play with 
<a href="http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html">ice</a>. The manual isn't too scary,
and I'd already be playing with it but the compile is taking ages. Maybe it
won't suck ;)

<p>

I do enough ad-hoc data analysis with grok, it seems like a fun adventure to
write some tool that accepts patterns and data input and gives you the results.
Rather than reinvent the rpc wheel, it's probably worth learning a
cross-platform rpc library.
