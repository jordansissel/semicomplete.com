<p>

This weekend is <a href="http://www.barcamp.org/BarCampBlock">BarCampBlock</a>
over in Palo Alto. It looks like more of a party than a BarCamp, but a block
party with BarCamp elements can be nothing but awesome.

<p>

I'm going. You should, too.

<p>

This will make my 4th barcamp (New York, San Francisco, and Stanford
previously). If you're interested in my experiences at prior barcamps, feel
free to look at my <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/tags/barcamp">posts covering past
barcamps</a>.
