I wanted to test something quickly out in C, but didn't want to write the 5
line of code to do it. Having done some fun ruby debugging with gdb recently, I
decided to go with that.

<pre>
% gdb -q `which sleep` --args `which sleep` 60000
(gdb) break nanosleep
(gdb) run
Starting program: /bin/sleep 60000
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
[New Thread 0x7f8c40bc46f0 (LWP 6504)]
[Switching to Thread 0x7f8c40bc46f0 (LWP 6504)]

Breakpoint 1, 0x00007f8c404f7ce0 in nanosleep () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) call strcspn("hello world", "w")
$1 = 6
</pre>

I don't know why I didn't think about this before. This is nicely useful, allowing me to easily test any simple function call unrelated.
