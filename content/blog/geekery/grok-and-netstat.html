What hosts is this machine connected to:
<pre>
% netstat -anfinet | perl grok -m "%IP:S%.*?%IP:D%" -r "%IP:D|ip2host%" | sort | uniq
fury.csh.rit.edu
mc-in-f104.google.com
mc-in-f147.google.com
scorn.csh.rit.edu
</pre>

I have no idea the mc-in-f104 stuff is, but firefox is open to 'www.google.com' right now. Let's find out what 'www.google.com' points at:

<pre>
% host www.google.com | perl grok -m "%IP%" -r "%IP|ip2host%"
mc-in-f147.google.com
mc-in-f99.google.com
mc-in-f104.google.com
</pre>

I keep finding more uses for grok now that you can use it on the commandline easily.
