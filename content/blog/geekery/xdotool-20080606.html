Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p/>

I've also put up an HTML version of the manpage: <a href="/projects/xdotool/xdotool.xhtml">xdotool.xhtml</a>.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20080606:
  * Correctly report an error if xdotool is invoked with an invalid command.
  * Fix invalid error code reporting from 'windowraise'
</pre>
