I got bored and went a'googling in search of wireless shenangians under linux.
I came across iwconfig(1) and iwlist(1) for rough equivilants of wicontrol(1).
I also need to yank someone's cisco aironet cards and add ancontrol(1)
support.<p>

I might aswell make "modules" for each wireless situation, since I seem to be
constantly coming up with more possibilities.<p>

It still makes me happy when I walk back from class and by the time I get to my
room my laptop's already associated to csh's network without any action on my
part. It still needs a few more features; downing/re-upping the device if there
is a network change so programs such as gaim and ssh will acknowledge
connection drops.<p>

More updates later...
