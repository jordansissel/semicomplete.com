Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20080603:
  * Daniel Kahn Gillmor reported a problem with return codes from xdotool. All
    commands return proper exit status now (0 == success, nonzero == error)
  * I tested on 3 window managers: Gnome2 2.20.0, OpenBox 3.4, ion-3rc-20070608
    - Gnome2 and OpenBox pass all tests.
    - ion-3 fails on any desktop-related methods (ion-3 lacks the support).
</pre>
