I've been doing research on the internets trying to get OpenLDAP to allow
simple binds that can authenticate against Kerberos. Turns out the default SASL
support is to only handle GSSAPI when talking to Kerberos V servers. This means
you can only authenticate if you have a kerberos tgt.

<p>

Problem with SASL/GSSAPI is that address book clients aren't going to support much beyond simple authentication over SSL. Thusly, we need a way to use a simple bind over SSL and still authenticate against Kerberos.

<p>

The LDAP Server's slapd.conf has the following to translate between gssapi auth DNs and real user object DNs:

<pre>
authz-policy from
authz-regexp "^uid=([^,]+),cn=gssapi,cn=auth" "uid=$1,ou=Users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu"
</pre>

This allows GSSAPI authentication:

<pre>
nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami
SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error (-2)
        additional info: SASL(-1): generic failure: GSSAPI Error:  Miscellaneous failure (see text) (open(/tmp/krb5cc_1001): No such file or directory)

nightfall(~) !1! % kinit psionic
psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU's Password: 
kinit: NOTICE: ticket renewable lifetime is 0
nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami
SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
SASL username: psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU
SASL SSF: 56
SASL installing layers
dn:uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
Result: Success (0)
</pre>

I have a TGT and can authenticate to LDAP over SASL (my ldap.conf defaults to sasl+ssl). However, when you try to do a simple bind:

<pre>
nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami -x -D 'uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu' -W 
Enter LDAP Password: 
ldap_bind: Invalid credentials
</pre>

On the slapd side, you'll see errors like:

<pre>
==> bdb_bind: dn: uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
SASL Canonicalize [conn=0]: authcid="psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU"
SASL Canonicalize [conn=0]: authcid="psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU"
SASL [conn=0] Failure: Could not open db
SASL [conn=0] Failure: Could not open db
</pre>

Googling around will tell you that lots of people put the following in their "slapd.conf" files:

<pre>
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
saslauthd_path: /var/run/saslauthd/mux
</pre>

Now, you'll recognize that this format of "token: value" doesn't match the
normal slapd.conf. There's a reason for this: This isn't OpenLDAP's slapd.conf
file. It's the config file for SASL! From what I gather, saslauthd is working
similarly to the way PAM works, in that it sees a service trying to use it and
uses that particular service's config file. I believe saslauthd comes with a
standard Sendmail.conf for example usage.

<p>

It took me several hours to find this fact out. My slapd SERVER config file is located here:<br>
/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf
<p>

While the SASL "slapd.conf" authentication config file is located here:<br>
/usr/local/lib/sasl2/slapd.conf
<p>

If you can't find the right place, look for 'Sendmail.conf' somewhere near
where you installed sasl or saslauthd.

<p>

Anyway, once we've added this magic config file and told it to use saslauthd,
the SASL library LDAP's slapd is using will now attempt communication with
saslauthd over the /var/run/saslauthd/mux socket. I ran saslauthd like this:

<pre>
/usr/local/sbin/saslauthd -a kerberos5 -d
</pre>

The directory, /var/run/saslauthd was owned by 'cyrus' and I changed the group
ownership to 'ldap' so that the slapd server (running as 'ldap') could access
the socket. This is a necessary step, else you will get Permission Denied
errors permissions disallow you from accessing the socket or its directory.

<p>

Now, once we have saslauthd running, the sasl library slapd.conf, and the moons
aligned, we can perform a simple bind:

<pre>
nightfall(~) % ldapwhoami -x -D 'uid=psionic,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu' -W 
Enter LDAP Password: 
dn:uid=psionic,ou=Users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
Result: Success (0)
</pre>

saslauthd, in debug mode, will say something meaningful such as:

<pre>
saslauthd[28910] :do_auth         : auth success: [user=psionic] [service=ldap] [realm=CSH.RIT.EDU] [mech=kerberos5]
saslauthd[28910] :do_request      : response: OK
</pre>

Whew! My LDAP Authentication journey is complete. I'll post my configs later
once I have a full directory system implemented here. For now, I am elated that
gssapi and simple binds both work for eventually authenticating against our
Kerberos server.
