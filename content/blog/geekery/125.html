I made a patch for freebsd -current's moused that lets you scroll up and down
while holding the middle mouse button and moving the mouse up and down. I
found this feature in windows on my laptop extremely useful, perhaps others
will now aswell in FreeBSD.
<p>
The patch is available aswell as the patched source (which may or may not work
for you). <br>
Usage - Copy the source or patch to <code>/usr/src/usr.sbin/moused</code>. If you got the patch, then do patch < moused-patch. Run <code>make all install</code> and it should build it and install it for you.<br>
Two new options are thus added to your moused: <code>-V</code> and <code>-U</code>. -V enables virtual scrolling and -U with a number parameters specifies the distance threshold (defaults to 5) before a scroll tick happens.
