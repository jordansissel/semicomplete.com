<p>

This event was absolutely beyond any of my expectations.

<p>

I was expecting a Mashup Camp-style event with a hundred or so people. I
certainly wasn't prepared for the event. Heck, I knew very little about the
event before showing up.

<p>

<b> Entertainment and Hospitality </b>

<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rossharmes/256505918/">And more Beck.</a>

Beck put on one of the best shows I've ever seen. The crowd was about 500
strong, I'd guess. The stage effects had the help of Puppetron,
who synchronized marionettes of the band with the band's movement. Very cool. A
summary of what Beck did during this concert can be found in a <a
href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=3&entry_id=5577">review
of another Beck concert</a>. Bears on stage. Seriously. Awesome.

<p>

To quote Beck Puppet, "I'm about to hack a bitch." Puppetron and Beck did a <a

hack video</a> for the event.

<p>

Other hospitality perks included many kegs of beer, tons of pizza, fifty-six
dozen Krispy Kremes for breakfast, and an extremely well organized staff.

<p>

<b> Before the event </b>

<p>

One of the rules of the event is that you ought to invoke one or more of the
available Yahoo! web API's in your code sorcerery. Prior to arriving, I wasn't
sure I wanted to do a web-based hack, so I was planning on not using any of the
APIs. I also showed up with no ideas. Hacking without a plan? Seemed to work
out. I found out at sometime around midnight during the event that there would
be prizes for the best hacks. My hacks would clearly not qualify, but whatever,
I was here to hack :)

<p>

<b> Hack Day </b>

<p>

I started with working on my binary screen partitioning tool. I
haven't found a good way to explain this application in words yet. Look at my
slides (link at bottom of this post) and it'll show you a screenshot-based
demo. I added a bit of more polish to it. I got bored after I ran out of code
to write, so I offered coding services in exchange for not being bored to Kevin
Marks. 

<p>

Idea bouncing led to me playing with the del.icio.us API. The end result was
something I term "jokeware" - a filesystem driver for storing real files in
del.icio.us. It was built as a joke just for the sake of trying it. It worked. 
The more technical details can be found in my slides. If you want to look at
the code, you'll have to use a decent webbrowser that supports "data:" urls.
View "tastydrive.py" on <a
href="http://del.icio.us/jlshackday/tastydrive">http://del.icio.us/jlshackday/tastydrive</a>.
And, yes. I am actually storing raw data in del.icio.us. It's a hack, and I
think it's hilarious. It's not fast enough to use to store anything meaningful.

<p>
Personally, I think my two projects are totally slick. Read about them on my slides:
<br>
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/presentations/hackday06/">My Slides for Hack Day '06</a>
<p>

I can't remember all the hacks I liked, but those I remember are here:
<ul>
  <li> Purse Hack. Pedometer + microcontroller + camera. Takes pictures every 100 steps.</li>
  <li> monologr(sp?) - record an audio stream while selecting images from flickr
  to create slideshow with an audio story. </li>
  <li> YahooSpace - bridge Yahoo 360 with MySpace. Society is doomed. </li>
</ul>


There was press <i>everywhere</i> at this event. Yahoo's PR folks did a
fantastic job of selling the existence of the event to the press. Local news,
Wall Stree Journal, etc. Journalists for publications as far as Germany were
here. At the end of the hack session, news coverage was shown on the projector.
Atleast three news channels covered the event.

<p>

The event was a huge success. To any of you Yahoo folk reading: Thanks for an
incredible event. Same time next year? ;)
