As it turns out, xpressive is (so far) exactly what I'm looking for.

<p>

'Dynamic regular expression' in Xpressive's docs are means that the regex
object comes from compiling a regex string, not from using the static regular
expression (aka coded in C++) that is the alternative. Very fortunately, you
can mix the uses of dynamic and static expressions, since both end up turning
into the same objects!

<p>

What I wanted was dynamic regexps with custom assertions, and here's how you do it:
<pre>
struct is_private {
  bool operator()(ssub_match const &sub) const {
    /* Some test on 'sub' */
  }
};

/* somewhere in your code ... */
sregex ip_re = sregex::compile("(?:[0-9]+\\.){3}(?:[0-9]+)");
sregex priv_ip_re = ip_re[ check(is_private()) ];
</pre>

This is excellent because this was one of the features of perl that kept me
from making grok available in any other language.

<p>

I have a <a href="/files/blogposts/20080109/boost_xpressive_test.cpp">working
demo you can download</a>. I've tested on Linux and FreeBSD with success. It
requires <a href="http://www.boost.org">boost</a>
1.34.1 and the xpressive 2.0.1. The version of xpressive that comes with boost
1.34.1 is insufficient, you must separately download the latest version of
xpressive. I installed it by unzipping it and copying
<code>boost/xpressive/*</code> to /usr/local/include/boost/xpressive/ - this
overwrote the old copy of xpressive I had installed.

<p>

Compile with (on freebsd, the -I and :
<pre>
g++ -I/usr/local/include -c -o boost_xpressive_test.o boost_xpressive_test.cpp
g++  boost_xpressive_test.o -o xpressivetest
</pre>

Running it:
<pre>
% ./xpressivetest 
RFC1918 test on '1.2.3.4': fail
RFC1918 test on '4.5.6.7': fail
RFC1918 test on '192.168.0.5': pass
Match on test1: 192.168.0.5
RFC1918 test on '129.21.60.0': fail
RFC1918 test on '29.21.60.0': fail
RFC1918 test on '9.21.60.0': fail
RFC1918 test on '172.17.44.25': pass
Match on test2: 172.17.44.25
</pre>

This is exactly the behavior I expected.
