Continuing the flashback series. Here's 2004. 

<p>

Still in school. Hacking on countless projects in perl.

<p>

While writing a command-line interpreter, I wanted you to be able to type 'st'
or 'sta' instead of 'status' and have the code find a best match for your
command. This is often called 'ambiguous commands' or somesuch. I came up with
a clever way to do this using <a href="/blog/geekery/113.html">regular expressions</a> (May 2004).

<p>

I also posted about using <a href="/blog/geekery/119.html">regular expression
to match quoted and nonquoted strings</a> (June 2004).

<p>

Finally, I experiment with using <a href="/blog/geekery/133.html">regular
expressions to find word boundaries</a> near the cursor for my command line
interpreter (Oct 2004).

<p>

Are you drowning in perl and regular expressions, yet? ;)
