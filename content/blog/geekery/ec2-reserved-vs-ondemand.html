I'm sure this is covered well elsewhere online, but that's never the point of
these things ;)

<p>

I was helping with some capacity planning and run-rate math today at work and
found that ec2 reserved instances are much cheaper compared to on-demand - If
this is obvious to you, chill out, I have historically never really used EC2
nor have I ever been close to budgeting. ;)

<p>

I proved this conclusion with some math, but frankly I like visualizations
better, so I decided to learn R. I wrote an R script that will graph an
on-demand vs reserved pricing for one m1.large instance (code at end of the
post).

<p>

The result is this graph:

<p>

<img src="/images/ec2_m1large_cost.png">

<p>

The graph says it all, and definitely tells me that we need to be reserving all
of our instances at Loggly - and it gives me a rule-of-thumb:

<ul>
  <li> If we're going to use one instance unit for at least 9 months, reserve for 3 years. </li>
  <li> If we're going to use one instance unit for at least 6 months, reserve for 1 year. </li>
  <li> Otherwise, stick with on-demand. </li>
</ul>

The "reserved instances" pay structure is you pay a one-time fee for access to
a reduced hourly rate.

<p>

This also means that our random "debug something" deployments that are shutdown
much of the time are probably best off being reserved instances as well- at
least for a 1-year thing - since we are likely to use those deployments for
more than half of a year.

<p>

A 3-year on-demand price for m1.large is just shy of $9000, which is twice
as expensive as the 3-year reserve. Capaticy plan and maybe start buying
reserved instances. Make your CFO happy.

<p>

And in case you were going to ask, I ran the same plot with data from EC2
"quaduple extra large" instances and the savings and break-even points were the
same. I bet the rest of the prices flow similarly.

<p>

The R script is follows, run it with 'R --save < yourscript.r':

<pre>
# Values taken from http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/
# for an m1.large ("Large") instance
on_demand_hourly = 0.34
reserve_hourly = 0.12
reserve_1year = 910       
reserve_3year = 1400

# quadruple extra large instances
#on_demand_hourly = 1.60
#reserve_hourly = 0.56
#reserve_1year = 4290
#reserve_3year = 6590

on_demand_daily = on_demand_hourly * 24
reserve_daily = reserve_hourly * 24
x <- c(0, 365)
y <- on_demand_daily * x

# Calculate day of break-even point reserve vs on-demand rates
break_1year_x = reserve_1year / (on_demand_daily - reserve_daily)
break_3year_x = reserve_3year / (on_demand_daily - reserve_daily)
