Now that I have all the hardware/bios problems fixed on this system, I've
started installing vitrual machines. However, getting vmware to go was no small
task.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> The install script failed to build the vmmon kernel module, so I hacked the script to not do it. </li>
  <li> Ubuntu has packages for vmmon and vmnet, but installs them in
  /lib/modules/.../vmware-server/ instead of /lib/modules/.../misc/ where the
  vmware init.d script expects them. Hacked that with a symlink. The init
  script looks for 'foo.o' and the ubuntu package provides 'foo.ko'.
  </li>
  <li> I couldn't verify my license key because vmware-vmx would fail to run
  with an error of "No such file or directory". Turns out this really means
  "You are running a 32 bit binary and I can't find the libraries it needs".
  The solution is to apt-get install ia32-libs and possibly others. </li>
</ul>

There are probably other hacks I had to do, but it's 5am and I don't remember
them right now.
