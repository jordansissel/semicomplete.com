<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/dear-ruby-and-python.html">Last night</a>, I mentioned that I wanted (?{ code }) in ruby and python.

<p>

I got bored tonight and decided to see how hard this would be to implement in ruby. Turns out it's not as bad as I thought, not that I'm finished yet.

<p>

<a href="/files/blogposts/20070826/test_new_re.rb">This ruby script</a> shows a
demo of what I have so far. The output is in comments in the script. There's a
few strange bugs yet, but I've nearly got it working properly. Something about
my coding or the way oniguruma does backtracking/failures keeps this from
working correctly on strings with multiple potential matches.
