I think I'm going to add a few new sections to the website, namely a
tips and tricks section for whenever I discover something neat and
such.<br>
I need to seriously sit down and learn python and possibly ruby. I've
played with pygame a little bit and it's way cool. I haven't been able
to do much (I want to do some sort of information-kiosk interface for
another project) with it due to my lack of python knowledge. Perhaps
I'll venture investing in a good book, I'm not sure yet.<br>
I'm going to start work on an XML schema for my posts, so instead of
doing silly things like <code>File:</code> directives, I can simply do 
in-line <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> tags. Flexibility++<br>
This will also make doing <code>post -e</code> much
simpler, in that I won't need any specialness to unparse the changed
directives.
