Last month, I wrote about <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/overriding-shared-library-functions.html">overriding
shared library functions</a>. I spent time today  working on that project and
it's to the point where I want to put it out for consumption. It's not perfect, but I've used it to easily override both libc and libX11 functions with great results.
