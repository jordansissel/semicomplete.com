On <a
href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2008/12/day-11-home-away-from-home.html">SysAdvent
Day 11</a> I covered the importance of having your own personal environment
carry with you. This includes your rc files like .vimrc, etc.

<p>

If you manage users with puppet, here's how to manage it with puppet while
falling back to a default skeleton (similar to /etc/skel) directory for users
who don't have individual ones:

<pre>
class user::people {
  # ...

  define localuser($uid, ...) {
    user {
      "$name":
        uid => $uid,
        ...;
    }

    file {
      "/home/$name":                                                              
        ensure => directory,                                                      
        owner => $name,                                                           
        group => $gid,                                                            
        source => [ "puppet:///user/home/$name/",                                 
                    "puppet:///user/skel/" ];                                     
    }
  }


  localuser {
    "jls": uid => 10000;
  }
}
</pre>

Puppet will first search for 'user/home/$name' on it's file server, and sync it
if it exists. If it does not exist, it falls back to 'user/skel'. The benefit
here is that whenever you update the default 'skel' directory, all users who
depend on it will be automatically updated by puppet.

<p>

<b>Update</b>: I've since stopped using this method to sync homedirectories.
Puppet (at time of writing, 0.25.1) is not smart about how it scans for files
to update when recursion is on - puppet walks all files in each homedir, even
if they aren't part of the file list to be pushed by puppet. I use the <a
href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/sysadvent/2008/day11/synchome.sh">synchome.sh</a>
script mentioned in sysadvent 2008 day 11 with a cron job. This cron job is
deployed with puppet.
