This script requires ksh. It makes use of a feature of ksh (zsh supports this too, but differently) called a co-process. A co-process is started by using the <code>|&</code> pipe at the end of a command. The file descriptor you use to write to is <code>&gt;&p</code>. To read from it, you use <code>&lt;&p</code>. Here's an example:
<pre>
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' |&
echo "hello there" >&p
exec 3>&p; exec 3>&-
cat <&p
</pre>
<br>
The output is:
<pre>
HELLO THERE
</pre>
<br>
WTF?! You might be confused, I was when I first started playing with these.
What happens is it runs <code>tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'</code> in the background as a
co-process. Then it echos "hello there" to the input of <code>tr</code>. To
signify that we are in fact done sending input, we have to close the input file
descriptor, this is done through 2 statements: <code>exec 3&gt;&p</code> - this
opens file descriptor 3 and has it output to the co-process. The next
statement, <code>exec 3&gt;&-</code>, tells ksh you want to close file
descriptor 3, which in turn closes the input to the co-process. The last line
should be fairly obvious: <code>cat &lt;&p</code> - it sends the output of the
co-process through <code>cat</code>.  <br>
Ok, so you want that script do ya? Look below.<br>
<br>
<pre>
#!/bin/ksh
[ $# -ne 2 ] && echo "Invalid parameters" && exit 1
telnet $1 $2 |&
cat <&0 >&p
sed -e '1,3d' <&p
</pre>
<br>
I won't get into much detail as to how things work here, should be pretty straight-forward. It takes 2 parameters, first being the host and second being the port. It reads from standard input and outputs to standard output.
