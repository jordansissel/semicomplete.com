I was working on integrating jQuery Mobile stuff into <a
href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fingerpoken">fingerpoken</a> and needed a
way to make the content area of pages full-screen. By 'full screen' I mean
still showing the header and footer, but otherwise the content needs to fill
the rest.

<p>

I couldn't find an easy way to do this while googling, and even the jQuery
Mobile demos didn't do it.

<p>

So here's a demo of what I came up with here: <a
href="http://semicomplete.com/files/blogposts/20101209/fullheight.html">fullheight
jQuery Mobile demo</a>

Javascript:

<pre>
  var fixgeometry = function() {
    /* Some orientation changes leave the scroll position at something
     * that isn't 0,0. This is annoying for user experience. */
    scroll(0, 0);

    /* Calculate the geometry that our content area should take */
    var header = $(".header:visible");
    var footer = $(".footer:visible");
    var content = $(".content:visible");
    var viewport_height = $(window).height();
    
    var content_height = viewport_height - header.outerHeight() - footer.outerHeight();
    
    /* Trim margin/border/padding height */
    content_height -= (content.outerHeight() - content.height());
    content.height(content_height);
  }; /* fixgeometry */

  $(document).ready(function() {
    $(window).bind("orientationchange resize pageshow", fixgeometry);
  });
</pre>
