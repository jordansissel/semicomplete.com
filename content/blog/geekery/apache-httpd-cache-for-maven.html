At work, I'm experimenting with Maven as a way to manage java package builds
and dependencies.

<p>

The maven mirror documentation says pretty explicitly "Do not rsync the entire
repo" - it recommends the use of caching proxies. We can do this trivially with
apache httpd.

<p>

<pre>
# httpd.conf:
ProxyPass /maven/proxy http://repo1.maven.org/maven2

# What http path to cache for
CacheEnable disk /maven/proxy
# Where on disk to store the cached data
CacheRoot   /srv/repo/maven/proxy

CacheDirLength 2
CacheDirLevels 3 

# Override default cache expiration and control
CacheDefaultExpire 2419200
CacheMaxExpire 2419200

# Ignore requests to not serve from cache. Maven data never changes.
CacheIgnoreCacheControl On

# Default max file size is 64K. Set to 1GB.
CacheMaxFileSize 1073741824
</pre>

The above config will take requests to http://yourserver/maven/main/... and
proxy them through to the main maven repo and also cache the fetch local to
your webserver so future fetches will be local.

<p>

You tell maven to use your local repo in ~/m2/settings.xml:

<pre>
  &lt;settings&gt;
    &lt;mirrors&gt;
      &lt;mirror&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;local-mirror&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Local maven mirror&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;-- Replace 'repo.local' with whatever your webserver's name is --&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;http://repo.local/maven/proxy&lt;/url&gt;
        &lt;mirrorOf&gt;*&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;
      &lt;/mirror&gt;
    &lt;/mirrors&gt;
  &lt;/settings&gt;
</pre>

Now all my maven dependency fetches are going through a local repo and files
get cached to disk for future requests.

<p>

Since I already had a repo server for local rpm and rubygems, pushing this 5
line httpd config change with puppet was practically a no-op in terms of
implementation.
