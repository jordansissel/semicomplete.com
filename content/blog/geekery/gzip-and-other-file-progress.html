While I wait for a mysql backup to replay against a test server, I was
wondering how far along the replay was.

<p>

I am building the database using this command:

<pre>
% gzip -dc admin.sql.20100511.060001.gz| mysql -uroot -proot
</pre>

<p>

Pipes have a finite buffer. That is, the mysql command is busy reading stuff
from stdin while gzip is busy writing to stdout. If gzip outputs faster than
mysql can consume, gzip will end up filling the pipe's buffer and its next
write will block, pausing it momentarily until mysql can catch up.

<p>

If we can inspect what position gzip is currently at, we can use that data
along with the input file size to give us a progress indicator.

<p>

In linux 2.6.22 and beyond, there is /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fdinfo which will tell you the
current seek position of any open file in a process, so let's use that. First
we'll need to find what file descriptor number is the input file, then ask what
position it is at.

<pre>
% pgrep -f 'gzip -dc admin'
6261
% PID=6261
% cd /proc/$PID/
% ls -l fd
total 0
lrwx------ 1 jsissel jsissel 64 May 11 15:04 0 -&gt; /dev/pts/12
l-wx------ 1 jsissel jsissel 64 May 11 15:04 1 -&gt; pipe:[31912237]
lrwx------ 1 jsissel jsissel 64 May 11 15:04 2 -&gt; /dev/pts/12
<b>lr-x------ 1 jsissel jsissel 64 May 11 15:04 3 -&gt; /home/jsissel/admin.sql.20100511.060001.gz </b>
% cat fdinfo/3
pos:    149028864
flags:  0104000

# Get the file size
% size=$(stat -L fd/3 -c "%s")

# Get the position
% pos=$(awk '/pos:/ { print $2 }' fdinfo/3)

% echo "$pos/$size" | bc -l
.25203137570698241973
</pre>

The above output says we are 25% complete.

<p>

You could go a step further and include the process uptime to show an estimate
of time remaining.

<pre>
cd /proc/$PID
size=$(stat -L fd/3 -c "%s")
pos=$(awk '/pos:/ { print $2 }' fdinfo/3)
start=$(date -d "$(ps -p $PID -o lstart=)" +%s)
now=$(date +%s)
echo "Minutes elapsed:"
echo "($now - $start) / 60" | bc -l
echo "Minutes remaining (estimated):"
echo "((($now - $start) / ($pos / $size)) - ($now - $start)) / 60" | bc -l

# Output
Minutes elapsed:
55.81666666666666666666
Minutes remaining (estimated):
110.58584668301847161105
</pre>

<b> Update: </b> Some commenters pointed out <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml">pv</a> as a solution here. It looks pretty good.
