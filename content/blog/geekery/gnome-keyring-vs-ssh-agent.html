A fellow sysadmin friend of mine has, from time to time, bitched about
performance problems with gnome's ssh agent called "keyring." I don't use
gnome, so I don't have his problems.

<p>

Yesterday, I wrote some ruby code that'll let you use your own ssh keys (and
agent) to sign and verify arbitrary strings. See <a
href="http://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-sshkeyauth">jordansissel/ruby-sshkeyauth</a>
on github. 

<p>

Putting the above module to work, I can easily compare signing speeds of agents
under various load conditions. The main complaint was that keyring falls apart
under parallel signing demands - a very common situation for any sysadmin that
sshes to more than one system at a time say, with a script, or capistrano, or
another similar tool.

<p>

Under single-client signing requests (one at a time), gnome-keyring on ubuntu
10.04 signed 1000 "Hello world" strings in 12.76 seconds; ssh-agent cut that
time by more than half achieving the same result in 5.05 seconds.

<p>

Under reasonable parallel load, ssh-agent's lead grew even further. On 4 cores,
5 'signing' processes, and 1000 signing requests each, the results are gnome-keyring
signing all 1000 requests on each of 5 processes in parallel in 113.23 seconds,
while ssh-agent signed the same in 30.61 seconds.

<p>

If you want to repeat my tests, you can use the 'samples/speed.rb' script from
the above ruby-sshkeyauth project on github. Single-thread tests were done
using <code>ruby speed.rb "Hello world"</code> while the 5-process test was done using
<code>seq 5 | xargs -P5 -n1 ruby speed.rb "Hello world"</code>.

<p>

So, if you're a regular user of ssh and ssh agents, you may want to stick with
ssh-agent rather than gnome-keyring-daemon given the huge performance lead
ssh-agent has.
