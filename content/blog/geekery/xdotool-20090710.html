Looking at svn logs for xdotool shows that the project is now just over 2 years
old. Crazy!

<p>

Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p/>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
20090710:
  * You can clear keyboard modifiers during typing now with --clearmodifiers
    When used, this flag causes physical keyboard modifiers (alt, control, etc)
    that are currently active to be ignored during typing.
    This is supported in: xdotool key, keyup, keydown, and type.
    
    Example: 
      xdotool type 'hello world' results in 'HELLO WORLD' while holding shift.
      xdotool type --clearmodifiers 'hello world' results in 'hello world'
        regardless of you holding shift.

    The 'reset' only happens at the beginning of typing and the modifiers are
    restored at the end. If you press a modifier key *during* typing it will 
    act as if --clearmodifiers was not present.
    (http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=6)

  * You can now specify literal keycodes for any key command.
    Example: xdotool key 38   (types 'a' with my keyboard)
    (requested via mailing list)

  * Regression fix: 'xdotool type' now properly obeys capitalization, again.
  * Bug fix: 'xdotool key --window' now works properly
</pre>
