All DNS servers should respond to invalid domains with advertisement space
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;, but OpenDNS takes it a step further, by responding to A
record queries that aren't possibly valid:

<pre>
% dig +short @208.67.222.222 "When is no-pants-o-clock?"
208.67.219.132
% dig +short @208.67.222.222 "$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=30 2> /dev/null)" 
208.67.219.132
</pre>

Good job.
