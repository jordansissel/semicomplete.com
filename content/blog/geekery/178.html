Some fairly significant updates to xml presenter today.

<p/>

There is now a "table of contents"-style list pane on the left of the browser window. It initially shows up as a very thin grey bar labeled 'Slides' which you can drag outward to reveal the slide list. The position of the slide list is kept in a cookie so it will be in the same place if you hit reload.It officially works 100% with Mozilla and Konqueror, and works almost entirely in Opera 8 (one minor feature fails). It's pretty broken in IE 6, but I'll work on fixing that (sigh). It probably doesn't work in Safari, but since Safari is based on KHTML it should work well. I had a friend test it in Safari and it was broken, so eh.
