More than a year ago, I <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/productivity/vim-indent.html">expressed
some frustration</a> about cindent in vim. My main complaints about it were
that it made bad decisions about indentation on some languages that were not
strictly C-syntax (perl, python, javascript).

<p>

Tonight I decided that I wanted to automate indenting to the closest '(' as in:
<pre>
if (foo() and bar()
    and baz):
    ^ Want to indent to here, somehow, on command.
</pre>

The 'cindent' feature of vim lets you configure this to happen automatically,
but in some cases it won't indent properly: ie; a comment with a ( at the end
of the line, for example, will screw it up.

<p>

I got tired of dealing with it, so I went back to autoindent, and I've been
happier ever after. Fooling around tonight, I started working on a vim function
to basically do exactly what I needed. An hour later, it was done. In the
process, I wanted to confirm the default actions of ctrl+f in insert mode,
which lead me to the cinkeys docs, which clued me that 'cindent' only
autoindents on certain occaisions. 

<p>

All of my time was wasted, it seems, after I figured out setting this option:
<pre>
set cinkeys=!^F
</pre>

Now cindent only activates when I hit ctrl+f. If I have both autoindent and
cindent enabled, with this cinkeys setting, the default indentation behavior is
exactly autoindent, and I can invoke cindent at will.

<p>

The following is now set in my .vimrc:
<pre>
set autoindent
set cindent                     " Use c-style indentation
set cinkeys=!^F                 " Only indent when requested
set cinoptions=(0t0c1           " :help cinoptions-values
</pre>

<p>
