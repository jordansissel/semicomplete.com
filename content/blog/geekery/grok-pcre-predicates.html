I finished the first function in pcre-grok's predicate feature.

<pre>
% ifconfig | ./grokre '%{IP}' IP
Entry: IP => 192.168.0.5
Entry: IP => 127.0.0.1

# Now, with a predicate:
% ifconfig | ./grokre '%{IP =~ /^192/}' IP
Entry: IP => 192.168.0.5
</pre>

The eventual plan is to allow users to register their own predicates. The first
target of this will be a python module wrapping grok allowing you to use grok
and additionally write predicate functions in python, executed inside the
regular expression.

<p>

So far, PCRE has not let me down.
