While doing backups of my important personal stuff (this website, my code,
etc), I found some presentations I'd done in school:

<ul>
<li> <a href="/presentations/mpi">MPICH 101</a> </li>
<li> <a href="/presentations/security">Hacking/Security 101</a> </li>
<li> <a href="/presentations/semantic-blogging">RDF/Semantic Web</a> </li>
</ul>

I also removed a pile of comments that were spam or people testing the comment
system. Some comments had unicode characters in them causing python to barf (I
have a python cgi script that helps me search/delete comments), but doing
<code>.encode("latin-1")</code> fixed it.

<p>

There were only a few spams that got past my scripts. I might add word
filtering to the pyblosxom comment plugin so crap mentioning viagra and cialis
won't even be permitted. Still seeing these happily in my logs:
