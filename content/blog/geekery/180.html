I got around to publishing a writeup on my ideas and progress on my latest
project to reengineer the mouse framework in FreeBSD. Assuming it gets finished,
it'll probably end up in FreeBSD 7.x. I've been working with one of the freebsd
committers (philip@freebsd) bouncing ideas around and such. I think the plans
I've got are fairly solid despite my lacking hardware/lowlevel programming
experiences. The existing mouse code is fairly easy to read so I'm using that
as a starting point for learning. I won't bother reiterating what's already on
another page, so if you're interested in telling me I'm completely wrong (or
suggesting features, or just reading for fun), then go on over to
