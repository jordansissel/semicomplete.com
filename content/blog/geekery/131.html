It's hard to listen to what I want when I want when I have to search through
cd booklets for the damn song, so I wrote a script that will rip the cd, grab
the track information from cddb, and encode it in ARTIST/ALBUM/TRACKNAME.mp3
format with proper id3 tags. It ejects the cd when ripping is done so you know
when to put a new cd in.
