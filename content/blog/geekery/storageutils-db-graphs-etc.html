Spent lots of time over thanksgiving playing with bdb in python.

<p>

Again, I still don't have releaseworthy code, but here's a snippet of rrdtool-like behavior from this system:

<pre>
% ./evtool.py create /tmp/webhits.db
% ./evtool.py addrule /tmp/webhits.db http.hit agg.http.hit.daily total $((60*60*24)) time
% time cat webhits.data | ./evtool.py update /tmp/webhits.db -
11.10s user 0.80s system 94% cpu 12.627 total
% time ./evtool.py graph /tmp/webhits.db agg.http.hit.daily  
0.49s user 0.11s system 96% cpu 0.624 total
</pre>

The result is exactly the <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/images/hits-1day.png">same graph</a> as
mentioned in my <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/eventdb-graphing.html">previous
post</a>. Speed so far is pretty good. The input was 125000 entries, in 12.6
seconds; which equates roughly to 10000 updates per second. That kind of
QPS seems pretty reasonable.

<p>

The primary difference today is that the aggregates are computed as data enters
the system. 'Addrule' tells the database to schedule an aggregation for
specific timestamps.

<p>

The goal is to be able to chain rules, and have N:M relationships between rule
input and output. Those will happen soon. Chaining would've happened tonight,
but I'm having some locking problems due to it being quite late ;)

<p>

The database code itself is designed to be reusable elsewhere. There are two
primary classes: SimpleDB and FancyDB. SimpleDB lets you store and retrieve
data based on row+timestamp => value pairs. FancyDB wraps SimpleDB and gives
you operation listeners such as the rule used in the above example.

<p>

I've already used SimpleDB elsewhere; in the sms traffic tool I mentioned <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/sms-traffic-reports.html">in my
last post</a>, I cache geocode data and traffic requests with this same
database tool.
