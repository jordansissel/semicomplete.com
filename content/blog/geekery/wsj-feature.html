Lee Gomes wrote an article about how I rocked the house at Yahoo! Hack Day.
This article is on the front page of the Marketing section (Page B1) of the
Wall Street Journal. I'm completely speechless. Lee did me quite an honor in
this feature.  I am so excited and happy right now. This is awesome.

<p>

One of my favorite parts is when he writes:
<blockquote>
  A number of Hack Day participants used the opportunity to strut their existing Web sites ("flipmeat," in the lexicon of the current Web 2.0 business bubble) in front of potential Yahoo acquirers.
</blockquote>

Hackday wasn't about demo'ing your fancy "Web 2.0" startup. It was about
building an idea from the ground up in 24 hours using any of the Yahoo! APIs.
To those of you who showed up at hackday and showed off your startup company:
Shame on you.

<p>

There were simple hacks such as Tantek (and a lady from Instructables) 's hack
which was a "send this picture as a postcard" greasemonkey extension. Built
that night and demoed hours later. Or, there was Mo(sp?)'s Captain Picard
mouth-puppet hack, hilarious!
