I'm always finding myself wanting to graph random data. Gnuplot is nice, but
not enjoyably scriptable. Matplotlib in python is too matlab-ish, or was when I
looked at it last (though it looks much improved now). Some ruby options exist
(even ruby+gnuplot), but none were much to my tastes.

<p>

I started fiddling around with <a
href="http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/">RMagick</a> and stumbled across what it
calls "RVG" (ruby vector graphics). From the site:

<blockquote>
RVG (Ruby Vector Graphics) is a facade for RMagick's Draw class that supplies a
drawing API based on the Scalable Vector Graphics W3C recommendation.
</blockquote>

The API is pretty reasonable and hasn't hindered me yet and feels good after
having hacked with it for a few hours: Simple operations like point
translation, scaling, rotating, flipping, etc are simple in code; the api is
well documented; images can be embedded easily into another which allows for
easily writing modular code.

<p>

Anyway, the goal of this adventure was to come up with something that would
produce non-crappy plots. Main emphasis on having a means to apply axis labels
and ticks that wasn't painful. The result is below: (x-axis ticks are
hour-aligned and have 12 hour steps, y-axis ticks are single-value aligned)

Here's the code that generates the above graph (using <a
href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/rplot/rplot.rb">rplot.rb</a>). A
lot of things (like axis label tick alignment and stepping) are hardcoded right
now, but that will obviously change if I decide this project needs attention
(and I don't find something that does the same thing but better).

<pre>
# graph some random stuff, like log(x) and sin(x)
# use time for the 'x' to demo time formatting
# each point is an hour (i * 3600)
graph = RPlot.new(400, 200, "Happy Graph")

points = 60
axis = GraphAxis.new
(1..points).each do |i|
  axis.points << [Time.now.to_f + i*3600, Math.log(i)]
end

axis2 = GraphAxis.new
(1..points).each do |i|
  axis2.points << [Time.now.to_f + i*3600, Math.sin((i / 2.0).to_f) + 1]
end

graph.axes << axis
graph.axes << axis2

graph.render("/home/jls/public_html/test.gif")
</pre>
