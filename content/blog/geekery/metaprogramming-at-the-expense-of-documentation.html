Ruby, like many other dynamic and modern languages, makes it easy for you to do
fun stuff like metaprogramming.

<p>

Ruby, also like other nice languages, comes with a builtin documentation
generator that scans your code for comments and makes them available in html
and other formats.

<p>

... until you start metaprogramming.

<p>

Take a simple example, the Fizzler! The name of the class is unimportant; this
class will simply provide a new way to define methods, simply for the sake of
showing some metaprogramming and how ruby's rdoc fails on it.

<p>

<pre>
class Fizzler
  def self.fizzle(method, &block)
    self.class_eval do
      define_method method, &block
    end
  end
end

class Bar < Fizzler
  # Print a worldly message
  fizzle :hello do
    puts "hello world!"
  end
  
  # A simple test
  def test
    puts "testing, 1 2 3!"
  end
end

# Now some sample code, let's invoke the new 'hello' method we generated with
# 'fizzle'.
bar = Bar.new
bar.hello
</pre>

The output looks like this:
<pre>
% ruby fizzler.rb 
hello world!
</pre>

All is well! We are generating new methods on the fly, etc etc, all features of
metaprogramming. However, we can never make this 'hello' method obviously
available to the world via rdoc, at least as far as I can tell. The rdoc
generated looks like this:

<p>

src="/files/blogposts/20091108/fizzler-rdoc-thumb.png"> </a>

<p>

Note the lack of any mention of 'hello' as a method. I cannot simply do what
works for lots of other normal ruby code and ask for the documentation of hello
by running 'ri Bar#hello' - because rdoc simply doesn't see it.

<p>

I recall in python, if you were dynamically generating methods and classes, you
could also inject their documentation by simply setting the '__doc__' property
on your class or method. Ruby doesn't appear to have such a thing.

<p>

Additionally, in some metaprogramming cases, the stack traces are actually
harder to read. For example, ActiveRecord makes extensive use of
'method_missing' rather than dynamically generate methods. The output is the
same, but the stacktraces are now littered with 'method_missing' and references
to files and lines you don't own, rather than containing stacktraces to
named functions and other useful pointers. This perhaps is a feature, but for
cases like method_missing, being able to add other useful data onto the stack
trace would greatly aid in debugging.

<p>

So, if long term necessities like documentation and easy debuggability (stack
traces, etc), are hindered by metaprogramming, at least in ruby, what are we
left to do? Metaprogramming is clearly a win in some places, but the automatic
losses seem to detract from any value it may have.
