The 'CiscoGate" talk just wrapped up.

<p>

I was at Defcon 13 when the Cisco/ISS fiasco was going on, but all I had heard
was rumors and gossip about what was going on. The talk had some really good content and filled in lots of gaps in information for me. Interesting to see how insane the problem (dealing with Cisco/ISS/FBI/etc) was and that it took 5 months after the event until the problem was fully resolved (the data was finally cleaned up to Cisco's satisfaction).

<p>

I tried to attend Bruce Potter's talk but it seems his popularity is too much
as a speaker, and we got booted out because there were too many people. Guess
I'll have to wait for the video.

<p>

I've also been working on some new shared library overriding code that I'll get
around to describing later.
