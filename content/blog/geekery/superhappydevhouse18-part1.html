I've been working on the jquery commandline tool. The base features work, now
all that remains is endlessly interating over adding features.

<pre>
% ./jquerycmd.sh --url http://www.google.com --query img
&lt;IMG width='276' height='110' src='/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif' alt='Google' /&gt;
% ./jquerycmd.sh --url http://www.technorati.com/ --query form
&lt;FORM method='post' action='/query.php'&gt;
        &lt;div class="controls"&gt;
            &lt;a href="/search?advanced"&gt;advanced search&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
... &lt; remainder cut &gt; ...
</pre>
