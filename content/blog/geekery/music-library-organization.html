My music collection was fairly randomly sorted. Until today. In the past, I had
ripped some of my CDs to random locations which inevitably moved around over
the years, for whatever reason. This made finding a particular song annoying
without something that already had parsed the ID3 tags. 

<p>

I tried to use iTunes to 'consolidate' my library into
/path/[artist]/[album]/[title].mp3 but for whatever reason it would get some
percentage complete and then die. I assume it has something to do with strange
non-alphanumeric upper-ascii characters in filenames and iTunes was using files
over a samba share.

<p>

Whatever the reason, I had to fix this myself. I have two scripts now. One
parses the ID3 tags and stores them in a file, and one uses that data to
organize songs into the aforementioned directory structure.

<p>

Scripts: <a href="/scripts/findsongs.py">findsongs.py</a> and <a href="/scripts/migratemusic.py">migratemusic.py</a>
