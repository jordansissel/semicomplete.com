Ruby has Logger. It is good, but strings suck. In a world where more and more people are using log data for inputs and analysis, structured data is good. I want to log structured data.

<p>

This lead to me subclassing Logger and additionally providing my own logger
format class. The code for this is in logstash, <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/logstash/source/browse/trunk/lib/logstash/logging.rb?spec=svn469&r=469">logging.rb</a>.

<p>

What did I add? Two main goals: First, improve context. Second, log structured data (objects). This is achieved by style changes (log objects, not strings), adding awesome_print support, adding code context to each log (line/file/method), etc.

<p>

To support the first goal (context), if the loglevel is 'debug' I will inspect
the call stack and include the file and line of code that is logging. I also
set the 'progname' to the name of the program by default.  To support the
second goal, log objects and improve how objects are formatted into strings
with Object#inspect (or <a
href="https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print">awesome_inspect</a>, if
available). 

<p>

Some examples:

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
>> logger = LogStash::Logger.new(STDOUT)
I, [2010-11-12T15:19:48.388469 #18782]  INFO -- : ["Failed: require 'ap' (aka awesome_print); some logging features may be disabled", #&lt;LoadError: no such file to load -- ap&gt;]
<i># This is an example of what javascript folks call 'progressive enhancement'
# - we still function if awesome_print is not available.</i>

>> logger.level = Logger::WARN
>> logger.warn("Hello")
W, [2010-11-12T15:20:05.465705 #18782]  WARN -- irb: Hello

>> logger.warn(["rejecting bad client", { :client => "1.2.3.4" }])
W, [2010-11-12T15:21:04.639404 #18782]  WARN -- irb: ["rejecting bad client", {:client=>"1.2.3.4"}]

>> logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
>> logger.warn("Hello")
W, [2010-11-12T15:21:57.754874 #18782]  WARN -- (irb):12#irb_binding: Hello
<i># Notice the context (file, line, method)       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# When DEBUG level is set only due to performance and verbosity concerns.</i>
</pre>

The main benefit personally is logging objects instead of strings, which you
can do, today, with the standard Logger. However, standard logger doesn't make
nice with awesome_print or add file/line/method context. Anyway, logging
objects lets you later hook a smarter error handling tool up to your
logging that can inspect the structured data rather than having to regex your
way through a single string.

<p>

If you have awesome_print available, the object output by my formatter gets
even more useful for human viewing:

Why log structured? Easier to parse and query later, like in a logstash query.
