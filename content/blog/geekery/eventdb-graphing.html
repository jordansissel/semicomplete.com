webhits.data contains updates of this format:
<pre>
http.hit@1193875199000000:1
http.hit@1193875200000000:1
http.hit@1193875213000000:1
http.hit@1193875214000000:5
</pre>

The values are hits seen in a single second to this website. This particular
data set includes only the past month's worth of data.

<p>

Let's graph "total hits per hour" over time.

<pre>
% ./evtool.py update /tmp/webhits.db - < webhits.data
% ./evtool.py fetchsum /tmp/webhits.db $((60 * 60)) http.hit
</pre>

60*60 is 3600, aka 1 hour. <a href="/images/hits-1hour.png">hits, 1 hour</a>. I
also reran it with 60*60*24 aka 24 hour totals. <a
href="/images/hits-1day.png">hits, 1 day</a>.

<p>

The data aggregation may be incorrect; not sure if I really got 12K hits on
each of the first few days this month. However, using fex+awk+sort on the
logfiles themselves shows basically the same data:

<pre>
 % cat access.* | ~/projects/fex/fex '[2 1:1' | countby 0  | sort -k2 | head -3
 11534 01/Nov/2007
 11488 02/Nov/2007
 11571 03/Nov/2007
</pre>

Actually looking at the logs shows 5K hits from a single IP on 01/Nov/2007, and
it's the googlebot.
