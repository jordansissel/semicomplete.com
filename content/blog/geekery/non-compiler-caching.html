I setup ccache again (trivial) to help me with building freebsd repeatedly. I
noticed that much of the time spent in the kernel build process was in building
dependency lists using awk.

<p>

Why couldn't we apply the ccache idea to everything else? If the same input
always means the same output, then we could cache it if it is computationally
expensive to compute that output.

<p>

Script: <a href="/files/blogposts/20080423/dcache.sh">dcache.sh</a>

<p>

Above is a hack that runs like ccache, but tracks all files created by the
process (and its subprocesses). Here's a sample run, of counting the number of
lines in a file with awk and outputing the result (within awk) to another file.

<pre>
% /usr/bin/time ./dcache.sh awk '{x++} END { print "Total records: " x > "/tmp/hello"}' bigdata
Running original...
        1.60 real         0.05 user         0.74 sys
% cat /tmp/hello
Total records: 1000000

# Remove the old output file
% rm /tmp/hello

# Rerun it again, unmodified, and it will use the cached output.
% /usr/bin/time ./dcache.sh awk '{x++} END { print "Total records: " x > "/tmp/hello"}' bigdata
Using cache...
        0.06 real         0.00 user         0.06 sys
% cat /tmp/hello
Total records: 1000000
</pre>

It doesn't work with everything just yet, but the problems seem to be with
truss's behavior and not the script's fault, like sometimes truss hangs, or it
doesn't follow a fork like it should. 

Beyond truss problems, the scripts doesn't track file renames. It also doesn't
understand how to figure out what the input files for each command is. Ideally
it would checksum any inputs and use that as the cache key; currently it only
checksums the commandline arguments and not the external files being used (such
as 'bigfile'). 

<p>

I started initially without using truss, but awk doesn't call open(2) via libc
when it opens files, for some reason, and I can't figure out a clean way to
capture specific function calls from a process (even a child process).

<p>

Dtrace would be sexy here, but it is unavailable in the main freebsd trunk.

<p>

The speedup is pretty obvious for cpu-intensive things, but the real test is to
see how it performs when working properly and hooked into the freebsd kernel
build.
