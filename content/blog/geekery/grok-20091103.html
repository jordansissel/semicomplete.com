Lots of changes since the last announced release. Grok should get some
more activity now that I'm actually using it in a few places. If you
find bugs or have feature requests, please file them on googlecode
issue tracker (see below)

<p>

The largest changes are:
<ul>
<li> we ship with Ruby and C API. </li>
<li> lots of new testing code. </li>
<li> we now use tokyocabinet internally instead of bdb. </li>
</ul>

This release has all tests passing in these configurations:
<ul>
<li> FreeBSD 7.1. tokyocabinet 1.4.30, pcre 8.00, libevent 1.4.12 </li>
<li> Ubuntu 9.04. tokyocabinet 1.4.35, pcre 7.8-2, libevent 1.3e-3 </li>
<li> CentOS 5.3. tokyocabinet 1.4.9-1, pcre 7.8-2, libevent 1.1a-3.2.1 </li>
</ul>

Thanks to Pete Fritchman, grok also ships with an RPM spec so you can 'rpmbuild
-tb grok-20091103.tar.gz' for simple build and deployment.  The spec builds
grok, grok-devel, and grok-ruby. 

<p>

I'm using this version of grok myself with good success. It's also
being used in the new logstash (log indexing tool) project for doing
log parsing.

Full changelist since the last announced release:

<pre>
20091103
 - New: ruby bindings are now really supported.
 - Change 'WORD' pattern to be word bounded (\b)
 - Move grok-patterns to patterns/base
 - update rpm spec to install patterns/base in /usr/share/grok

20091102
 - Add a bunch of tests, mostly in ruby, to exercise grok. This uncovered a
   few bugs which are fixed.
   All tests currently pass (both CUnit and Ruby Test::Unit) on:
   * FreeBSD 7.1. tokyocabinet 1.4.30, pcre 8.00, libevent 1.4.12
   * Ubuntu 9.04. tokyocabinet 1.4.35, pcre 7.8-2, libevent 1.3e-3
   * CentOS 5.3. tokyocabinet 1.4.9-1, pcre 7.8-2, libevent 1.1a-3.2.1
 - When making strings in ruby, we now make them tainted per ruby C docs.
 - "Too many replacements" error will now occur if you have cyclic patterns,
   such as defining 'FOO' to be '%{FOO}'. Max replacements is 500.

20091030
 - Make 'grok' main take a config for an argument.
 - Add grok rpm spec.
 - Updated Makefile to work on Linux and FreeBSD without modification.
 - Fixed bug introduced in 20091022 where capture_by_(name,subname) didn't
   work properly.
 - Add default values for match {} grok.conf blocks:
   shell: stdout
   reaction: "%{@LINE}"
 - Have grok exit nonzero if there were no reactions executed, akin to grep(1)
   not matching anything. 'reactions' are important here; matches with no
   reaction will not count as a reaction.

20091023
 - Fix libgrok accidentally sharing it's parser/lexer functions. Turns out,
   libgrok doesn't actually need to parse the grok.conf, so we don't build
   against it anymore for the library.

20091022:
 - Convert to using tokyocabinet instead of berkeley db.
   * Berkeley DB isn't easy to target across platforms (4.x versions vary
     wildly in bugs)
   * tokyo cabinet should be faster
   * tokyo cabinet is less code to write, and slightly more readable in the
     author's opinion.
   * we don't have to serialize with xdr anymore

20091019:
 - include pregenerated bison/flex output since gnu flex varies much from
 non-gnu flex, and many important platforms don't have gnu flex available
 easily from packages (freebsd, centos, etc) but come with the other flex.

 No functional changes.
