<h4>Solaris Audio Controller</h4>
I got tired of trying ot use Solaris' graphical audio controller, <code>sdtaudiocontrol</code>. It's slow locally, slower to xforward, etc. So I went on down to <a href="http://docs.sun.com">docs.sun.com</a> and started perusing the documentation on <code>audio(7I)</code> and <code>mixer(7I)</code>. A few hours later, BOOM, I've got a commandline audio control utility.<br>
It's written in C and requires nothing. Compile it with: <code>cc -o solaudio solaudio.c</code>.
