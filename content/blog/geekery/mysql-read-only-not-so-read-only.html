I recently had to do a master failover in mysql to bring up a new mysql master
to replace an older one.

<p>

The switchover went awry shortly after we told the old master to start slaving
off of the new master. The output of 'show slave status' indicated a halt of
replication due to foreign key constraints: an auto_increment primary key had a
duplicate insert attempt. How did this happen? I'm not sure yet, still digging.

<p>

This puzzle made me wonder how we got into that state given that I put the old
master in 'read only' mode before doing the switch. Turns out, there are some
edge cases that are permitted even in read-only mode. The docs have this to
say:

<blockquote>
When it is enabled, the server allows no updates except from users that have
the SUPER privilege or (on a slave server) from updates performed by slave
threads.
</blockquote>

<p>

The above exceptions sound pretty reasonable, but I found an undocumented
exception: uncommitted transactions can be committed even in read-only mode.

<p>

This breaks my expectation that setting read_only means that as soon as this
setting goes 'true' all writes will fail. This means your backups aren't
consistent when using read_only unless you lock all your tables during the
backup. Additionally, commits made after read_only is set will bump the binlog
position, meaning if your backups do "set readonly, copy master status,
mysqldump", then you may break things because your mysqldump may have data that
includes things in the future of the master status you recorded.

<p>

It looks like this is fixed in MySQL >=5.1.15. The docs say that later versions
will cause setting read_only to block while there's a pending  transactions.

<p>

Related to the original problem (replication failover), I think we should've
just locked all the tables then restart the old master in read_only mode rather
than simply setting read_only.

<p>

Below is an example of 'read_only' being set and a transaction commit as
non-superuser resulting in a data write. I have aligned the actions
side-by-side as they were executed chronologically.

<p>

Note the master status binary log position had changed after the commit. This
is expected after a normal database write. You can also see the table was
actually updated. I wasn't expecting any writes to succeed when read_only is
set:
