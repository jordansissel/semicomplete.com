<pre>
function screen-sessions {
   typeset -a sessions
   for i in /tmp/screens/S-${USER}/*(p:t);  do
      sessions+=(${i#*.})
   done

   reply=($sessions)
}

compctl -K screen-sessions screen
</pre>

Completion chops off the PID of the screen session, so i can do:

<pre>
screen -x log<b>[TAB]</b>
</pre>
 and it will complete to 'screen -x logwatch'

<p>

Hurray.
