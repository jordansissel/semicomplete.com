Hurray! I finally got around to hacking a little script for vim that will
automatically track posting dates for pyblosxom entries. It does the following:

<ol>
	<li> For new entries, add '#mdate {currentdate}' on the 2nd line. </li>
	<li> For existing entries without '#mdate' metadata, it will look up the
	mdate of the current entry and append it in the form, '#mdate {mdate of file}'</li>
	<li> After you write (:w, :wq, etc), vim will look for #mdate metadata and
	turn the date into something touch(1) can use, then set the modification
	date of the file.</li>
</ol>

This seems to work pretty well, and is quite transparent to pyblosxom, since it
sees lines beginning with #foo as "metadata" - so far so good. However, it does jump to the 2nd line of the file when you save, which is annoying (but fixable). I'll fix that later.

<p>

My "vim scripting"-fu is not strong, so there's probably a cleaner/fancier way to do this. Anyhoo, you'll need the following in your .vimrc:

<pre>
" PyBlosxom stuff
augroup pyblosxom
	autocmd BufReadPost /home/jls/public_html/entries/*/*.txt call Pyblosxom_checkdate()
	autocmd BufNewFile /home/jls/public_html/entries/*/*.txt call Pyblosxom_putdate()
	autocmd BufWritePost /home/jls/public_html/entries/*/*.txt call Pyblosxom_fudgedate()
augroup end

function Pyblosxom_checkdate() 
	" Look in the file for '#mdate foo' metadata
	normal 1G
	let dateline = search("^#mdate")

	" If not found, append the mdate of the file to line 2
	if dateline < 1
		let dateline = 1
		let date = system("stat -f '#mdate %Sm' " . expand("%"))

		" Add the date to the file on line 1
		1put=date
	endif
endfunction

function Pyblosxom_putdate()
	let date=strftime("#mdate %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y")
	1put=date
	goto 1
endfunction

function Pyblosxom_fudgedate() 
	let l=search("^#mdate")
	let l=strpart(getline(l), 7)
	let cmd="date -j -f '%b %e %H:%M:%S %Y' '" . l . "' +%y%m%d%H%M"
	let touchtime=system(cmd)
	let touchcmd="touch -t '" . strpart(touchtime,0,strlen(touchtime)-1) . "' '" . expand("%") . "'"
	call system(touchcmd)
	e
endfunction

</pre>
