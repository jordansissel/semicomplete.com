Another year, another Defcon.

<p>

I'm heading up a day early for my bachelor party (woo!) and then it'll be the
Con all weekend. If you're going, email me and let me know where you are.

<p>

I'm eager to watch Kaminsky talk about how awesome he is for [insert reason].
He's deliciously full of himself (not that he doesn't release interesting
things). Lots of other talks look interesting, so it should be a good weekend
full of booze and geeking.
