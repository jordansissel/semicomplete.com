Using DHCP on resnet only gives me <code>search rit.edu</code> as far as search domains. So, I got bored and wrote a small script to add useful domains for me. This is done using a feature of ISC's dhcp program, dhclient, called dhclient-exit-hooks. This is a shell script that is run when dhclient finishes fetching you an IP address.
<br>
This will add <code>csh.rit.edu</code> and <code>cs.rit.edu</code> to the search line in my /etc/resolv.conf.<br>
<b>Requires:</b> a version of sed that supports inline editing (the -i option)
<p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

DOMAINS="csh.rit.edu cs.rit.edu"

for dom in $DOMAINS; do
        grep "^search.*\b$dom\b" /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null 2>&1 || 
        sed -i -e "/^search/ s/$/ $dom/" /etc/resolv.conf
done
</pre>
