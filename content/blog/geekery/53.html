I'm still awake from last night, yadda yadda yadda.<br>
So I got leet with my vim stuff and wrote a keymap that automatically
generates an attached pgp signature. I should note, however, that you'll
have to run <code>mime</code> from <code>whatnow</code> or run
<code>mhbuild</code> yourself, before you send out your email.
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="pre">
<tr><td><code>
" MH comp header/body separator<br>
let g:mhseparator="---------"<br>
<br>
if bufname(1) == '/u9/psionic/Mail/draft'<br>
   set tw=72<br>
   map \t :w&lt;CR&gt;1G:exec "/^" . g:mhseparator . "$"&lt;CR&gt;jyG:enew&lt;CR&gt;PGdd:w! ~/tmp/.draft&lt;CR&gt;:bn&lt;CR&gt;O#&lt;text/plain&lt;ESC&gt;Go#&lt;application/pgp-signature&lt;ESC&gt;:exec "r!gpg --detach-sign --no-secmem-warning --output - --armor --textmode ~/tmp/.draft"&lt;CR&gt;<br>
endif<br>
</code></td></tr>
</table>
This should be placed in your <code>.vimrc</code>. The only thing I'll
really mention above is the <code>g:mhseparator</code>. This should be
exactly the same line that separates your headers from your body (comp,
repl, and forw formatting)<br>
Just modify the variable in <code>.vimrc</code> to match your comp format.<p>
One final note: To get the pgp signature mail part to play nice with
mhbuild, you'll have to add this line to your
<code>.mh_profile</code><br>
<code class="pre">mhbuild-compose-application/pgp-signature:</code><p>

This just lets mhbuild know of the existance of <code>Content-Type:
application/pgp-signature</code>.

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="600"
style="width:600px;border-bottom:1px solid
lightgrey"><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>

So the other update is to my mailfilter script. It now supports better
html stuffs and pgp signature verification. I've done a bit of testing
with other people's pgp signature attachments (though not extensive) and
trial runs verifying emails tagged by vim keymapping above. It seems to
work pretty well.<br>
