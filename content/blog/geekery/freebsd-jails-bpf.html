Tonight's fun was spent learning bpf's internals (the pseudo-machine code it
uses). The point was to find out exactly how much effort it would take to add
secure bpf support to jails. Ideally, we'd want to expose the bpf(4) device to
any jail but only make available the traffic that is actually destined for the
jail (or broadcast traffic).

<p>

It seems like you could get away with this, if you prefixed all jailed bpf
filters with: <i>(ip and (host [jail_ip] or multicast or broadcast))</i>.

I've got userland-code that does exactly this. Once I knew how to inject my own
bpf code into an existing bpf_program struct, I was basically ready to go. The
only other thing left was to figure out how, in the FreeBSD kernel, to figure
out if you were in a jail and what that jail's IP was - turns out this is a
trivial operation :)

Working Patch: <a href="/files/blogposts/20080611/bpf-jail.patch">bpf-jail.patch</a>

<p>

The code in the patch is crappyish and has a pile of debug statements, but it
does appear to work as intended.
