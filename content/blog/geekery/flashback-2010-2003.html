<a href="http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/">Matt Simmons</a> suggested
that this week be a flashback
week. That's easy enough to do, so I'm doing one per year starting in 2003.

<p>

A common feature request of vim is to be able to split window and have a shell
be there. Well, as it turns out, that's easy to do if you run vim inside screen
(gvim not applicable here).

<p>
The original post details a simple vim keybinding that will split the screen
and attach a shell and close the split when the shell exits.

Neat vim/screen trick</a>

<p>

However, I've got a better version now.

You'll want this script, "screener.sh":
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

screen -X split
screen -X focus down
screen -X screen sh -c "cd $PWD; $SHELL; screen -X remove"
</pre>

Then in your .vimrc:
<pre>
:map \s :silent !screener.sh&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>

The new version mostly puts the screen invocations into a shell script. Another
improvement is to change to $PWD so the new shell will be in the same working
directory as vim started in.
