Another puppet camp has come and gone, and I'm certainly glad I went.
Puppet, the surrounding ecosystem, and its community has grown quickly since
last year.

<p>

The conference was the same format as last year. The morning was single-track
presentations from various puppet users, and the afternoon was
openspace/barcamp-style break out sessions. It was good to see some old faces
and also to finally put faces to IRC and twitter names.

<p>

One of the bigger announcements was that <a
href="http://marionette-collective.org/">mcollective</a> would join the Puppet
project. Other announcements included new employees and other good news. Beyond
that, I picked up a few tricks and learned more about the puppet roadmap.

<p>

In no particular order - some thoughts and notes.

<p>

Facter 2.0 will be good. Take lessons learned from Facter 1.x and improve
things - Make the DSL for making facts simpler, add structured data, add
caching, etc. 

<p>

Puppet supports a "config_version" option that specifies a script that
will override how the version of a given catalog is determined. Useful for
tagging based on revision control or deployment versions. 

<p>

Scoped defaults such as '<code>File { owner => root }</code>' apply
downwards in all cases, something I hadn't considered before. That is, if you
are class 'foo' and define a default and also include class 'bar', the default
in foo will apply to bar as well.  This was new to me, and I will be cleaning
up some of my manifests as a result (I use defaults in some classes but not
others).  Best practice here is to either use no class-specific defaults or use
class-specific defaults in every class. 

<p>

Twitter operations (John Adams) gave a talk covering their automation/puppet stuff.
John talked about problems with sysadmins trying to hack around puppet by using
<code>chattr +i</code> to prevent puppet from modifying certain files - a
practice they heavily discouraged. He also mentioned problems with poor cron
scheduling and presented the usual <code>sleep $(($RANDOM % 600))</code>-style
solution. I didn't get around to sharing my <a
href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2009/12/cron-practices.html">cron
practices (sysadvent)</a> with John before the end of the con. He also
mentioned having problems with home directory syncing using puppet, which was
another solution I'd covered that <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/puppet-manage-homedirectory-contents.html">here</a> and better solved <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2008/12/day-11-home-away-from-home.html">previously on sysadvent</a>. 

<p>

During some downtime at the conference, I started working on an ssh key
authorization module for mcollective. The ruby ssh key code is <a
href="http://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-sshkeyauth">here</a> and the
mcollective fork with the sshkey security plugin is <a
href="http://github.com/jordansissel/marionette-collective">here</a>. It works
pretty well:

<pre>
snack(~) % sudo grep security /etc/mcollective/{server,client}.cfg
/etc/mcollective/server.cfg:securityprovider = sshkey
/etc/mcollective/client.cfg:securityprovider = sshkey
snack(~) % mc-ping                                         
snack.home                               time=97.81 ms
</pre>

The gist of the key signing pieces is that your ssh agent signing authenticates
you as a user for requests, and for responses the server signs messages with
its own ssh host key (like /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key). Validation of you as a
user is done through your authorized_keys file, and validation for the reply
uses your known_hosts file to verify the host signature.

<p>

It was a good conference, though I would've enjoyed a more hackathon-style
atmosphere. We tried to do a facter hackathon, but there wasn't enough time, so
instead we code reviewed some of the sillier parts of facter and talked about
the future.
