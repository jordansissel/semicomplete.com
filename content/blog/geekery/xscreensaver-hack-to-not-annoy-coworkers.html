I'm almost guaranteed to be wearing headphones while at work. I like music.
However, when I leave my desk, I rarely pause mplayer. This leaves my
headphones leaking out some barely audible nois that may annoy coworkers.

<p>

I always lock my workstation when I'm not at my desk. How do I automate a solution here?

<p>

xscreensaver lets you watch the state of the screensaver. Let's use this to pause mplayer when I leave, and unpause it when I return.

<pre>
xscreensaver-command -watch \
  | while read a; do
    echo "$a" | grep '^LOCK' &amp;&amp; pkill -STOP mplayer
    echo "$a" | grep '^UNBLANK' &amp;&amp; pkill -CONT mplayer
  done
</pre>

Running the above, mplayer gets suspended when I lock my workstation, and
resumed when I unlock it.
