Today's efforts are summarized best by:
<pre>
% ./xdotool search "Mozilla Firefox"
31457484 
% xwininfo -id 31457484 | egrep 'Width|Height' | paste - -
  Width: 1278     Height: 1008
% ./xdotool windowsize `./xdotool search "Mozilla Firefox"` 500 500
% xwininfo -id 31457484 | egrep 'Width|Height' | paste - -
  Width: 500      Height: 500
</pre>

This new 'search' command will walk the list of windows in X and basically
output any windows with a matching title, name, or class. In this case, I have
1 "browser" window open under firefox that has "Mozilla Firefox" in the title.
So I then resize it to 500x500, trivially.

<p>

Longer summary of today is that I added 4 new functions to xdotool:
<ul>
  <li>windowsize &lt;windowid&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;</li>
  <li>windowfocus &lt;windowid&gt;</li>
  <li>windowmove &lt;windowid&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;</li>
  <li>search &lt;regexp&gt;</li>
</ul>

Thanks to valgrind, I also fixed the crashes in Linux. Was due to an off-by-one
bug. Sweet tool: valgrind.

<p>

Turns out XTEST works as I'd expect, and this example will do what you think,
and switch to the 2nd console (assuming you're running one).
<pre>
% ./xdotool key "ctrl+alt+F2"
</pre>

<p>

Goal: Focus the first window found that is a local xterm (ie; not ssh'd anywhere). My xterms have title with 'host(pwd) - activity' in them. So if my local host is 'snack' I can do:

<pre>
# Look for xterms starting with 'snack(' and focus the first one
./xdotool search '^snack\(' | head -1 | xargs ./xdotool windowfocus
</pre>

And magically one of the xterms running a shell locally is focused. I can see
this being pretty useful.
