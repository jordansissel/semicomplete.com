Now that I'm nearly settled in my new apartment, I need to start working on some new, cool projects to make it better.

<p>

<dl>
  <dt>pimp, version 5</dt>
  <dd> Pimp v4 was my excuse to learn python. It's great, but needs serious
  work. Now that I know python better, I think it's time to revisit this
  project with a complete rewrite. Reinventing the wheel isn't always good, but
  it's a fun exercise and certainly a useful project. </dd>
  <dt> web-based home automation </dt>
  <dd> Home automation kits are extremely expensive. I'm hoping to leverage
  LIRC, my X10 equipment, and the web to create a one-shot portal for
  controlling most of the devices in my apartment. The end-goal is to be able
  to click a button and have the TV switch to "input 3" and tell my receiver to
  switch to "dvd". Perhaps some sexy light dimming or something, aswell, with
  my x10 stuff. Mostly with one or two button clicks.  </dd>
</dl>

If you've got lirc experience, let me know. I'm looking to build both a
receiver and transmitter. Receiver for recording IR signals from my other
remotes and the transmitter for obviously replaying those signals.

<p>

Other hacks will probably include low-tech ones to hide wire mess, etc.
