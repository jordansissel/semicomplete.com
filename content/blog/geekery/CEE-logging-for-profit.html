I wrote this post a few months ago, but never got around to publishing it.

<p>Anyway, someone mentioned 'project lumberjack' and I found it was based on <a href="http://cee.mitre.org/">CEE: Common Event Expression</a>. CEE is a sort of comedic tragedy of design.</p>

<p>The effort is owned by a "non-profit" (MITRE), but the complexity and
obfuscation in CEE can only drive towards one thing: consultant profits.
I had a go at explaining what I describe in this post on the 'project
lumberjack' mailing list, but I did it quite poorly and got a few foot-stomps
in response, so I gave up.</p>

<p>CEE is a failure because, while claiming to be a standards effort, it <strong>maximizes
incompatibility</strong> between implementations by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>poorly describes multiple serialization formats, requires none of them.
  <em>This ensures maximum incompatibility in event serialization</em></li>
  <li>defines requirements for log transport protocols, but does not describe
  an actual protocol. <em>This ensures maximum protocol
  incompatibility</em></li>
  <li>naming style inconsistencies <em>This ensures confusion</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the goal of CEE sounds like, but is actually not, creating a
standard for common event expression. Instead, CEE is aimed at ensuring
consulting dollars through obfuscation, complexity, and inconsistency.</p>

<h1 id="inconsistency">Inconsistency.</h1>

<p>No consistency in naming.  Some names are abbreviations like ‘crit’, some
are prefixed abbreviations (“p_” prefix), some are full english words like
‘action’. </p>

<p>If the goal was to be inconsistent, CEE has succeeded.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mysterious ‘p_’ prefix.
Base fields are abbreviated names like “crit”, “id”, “pri”, yet others are
called “p_app”, “p_proc”, and “p_proc_id”.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Some fields are abbreviated, like “crit” and “pri”, but others are full
english words, like “action” and “domain”</p>
  </li>
  <li>there’s “id” which marks the “event type” by identifier, but “uuid” which
marks the event instance identifier. You are confusing. I’m still not sure
what the purpose of ‘uuid’ is.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="etoomanyprotocols">ETOOMANYPROTOCOLS</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Serializations: JSON, RFC3164, RFC5424, and XML serializations</li>
  <li>4 conformance levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pick one serialization and one transport (“conformance”) requirements list.
Describe those two. Drop all the others.</p>

<p>If I pick JSON, and you pick XML, we can both be CEE-conforming and have zero interoperability between our tools. Nice!</p>

<h1 id="serialization-underspecified">Serialization underspecified</h1>

<p>JSON for event serialization is fine, but no message framing is defined. Newline terminated? Length prefixed? You don’t know :(</p>

<h1 id="json">JSON</h1>

<ul>
  <li>“Reserved Characters” - I don’t think you have read the JSON spec. Most
(all?) of the ‘escaping’ detailed in CEE JSON is already specified in JSON:
<a href="http://www.json.org/string.gif">http://www.json.org/string.gif</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Specific comments on the ‘json’ format inline as comments, this example was
copied verbatim from the CEE :</p>

<pre><code>{
    # Forget this "Event" crap, just move everything up a level.
    "Event": {
        "p_proc": "proc1",
        "p_sys": "host.vendor.com",
        "time": "2012-01-18T05:55:12.4321-05:00",
        "Type": {
            # Action is like, edge-trigger information.
            # Status is like, line-trigger information.
            # You don't usually have both edge and line triggers in the
            # same event. Confusing.
            "action": "login",
            "status": "ongoing",

            # Custom tag values also MUST start with a colon? It's silly to make
            # the common case (custom tags) the longer form.
            # Also, tags is a plural word, but the value is a string. What?
            "tags": ":hipaa"
        },
        "Profile": {
            # This is a *huge* bloat, seriously. Stop making JSON into XML, guys.
            "CustomProfile": {
                "schema": "http://vendor.com/events/cee-profile.xsd",
                "new_field": "a string value",
                "new_val": 1234,
                "product_host": "source.example.com"
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you include the schema (CEE calls it a Profile) in <em>every</em> message, you’re
just funding companies who’s business model relies on you paying them per-byte
of log transit.</p>

<p>Prior art here for sharing schema can be observed in the Apache Avro
project, for example.</p>

<h1 id="clt-protocol">CLT Protocol</h1>

<p>Just define the protocol, all these requirements and conformance levels make
things more confusing and harder to write tooling for.</p>

<p>If you don’t define the protocol, there’s no incentive for vendors to use prior
art and are just as likely to invent their own protocols. </p>

<p>Combining this incentive-to-invent with the whole of CEE that underspecifies just about every feature, this guarantees incompatibilities in implementations.</p>
