A new release of xdotool is available. It fixes <a href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3Axdotool-20090126">two bugs</a> that were moderately annoying.

<pre>
20090126:
  * Change the default behavior of 'getwindowfocus' to get the first
    ancestor-or-self window that has WM_CLASS set. WM_CLASS will be set on
    (all?) top-level windows and it's possible that the currently focused window
    according to X is not a top-level window. To use the previous behavior, use
    'getwindowfocus -f'
  * Make 'xdotool key at' work correctly. 'at' is usually Shift+2, for example.
    Now all shifted characters should work, but I've only tested on a US
    keyboard.
  * Minor Makefile fixes for package maintainers.
</pre>

I've tested it in GNOME and Ion-3 with success.
