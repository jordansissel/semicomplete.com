I'm in the process of feeling out my options for the pimp rewrite. I've started with Pylons. Pylons gives me an actual framework and lets me choose implementations.

<p>

The database back is going to be SQLObject. I've been playing with it for 10 minutes. I haven't written a single line of SQL, and I've already got objects mapping to an sqlite database. Insertion is so cool. I simply instantiate an object and it gets inserted to the database. The potential to write database-backed systems without having to understand SQL is quite cool.

Neat. More on sqlobject as I learn it?
