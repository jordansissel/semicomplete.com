I got enough feature requests for grid support (in various layouts) that I
decided it was time to add generic grid support. You can now use grid movement
on grids of any configuration, 2x2, 3x3, 2x3, etc.

<p>

Hop on over to the <a href="/projects/keynav">keynav project page</a> and
download the new version.

<p>

The changelist from the previous announced release is as follows:

<pre>
  Feature request: Grid support.
  * New command: 'grid NxM' N and M are row and columns, respectively.
    You can divide the screen into any number of rows and columns.
    The default is 2x2.
  * New command: 'cell-select N' or 'cell-select NxM'
    With this command you can select a specific cell to zoom to.
    Usage: cell-select N
      Selects the Nth cell, counting from top left to bottom right.
      The order of a 3x3 grid would be:
        1 2 3
        4 5 6
        7 8 9
    Usage: cell-select NxM
      Selects the specific cell at NxM. '2x2' will select row 2 column 2.

  Other important changes:
  - Whitespace before command names works now.
  - Added a pile of new examples in keynavrc.
</pre>
