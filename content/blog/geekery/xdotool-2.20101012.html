New xdotool for your enjoyment. Lots of features and bug fixes. Huge thanks to 
folks who sent in bug reports, patches, or ideas. This version should be ABI
compatible to the previous release. All tests are passing (270 tests, 2838
assertions).

<p>

Major changes:
<ul>
  <li> New commands: behave_screen_edge, windowminimize, exec </li>
  <li> Add static build ('make xdotool.static')</li>
  <li> Add 'restore' feature to 'mousemove'. </li>
  <li> Improvements to xdotool 'script' behavior. Patch from Henning Bekel. </li>
</ul>

<p>

Cool tool: With the new screen edge behavior, added <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/source/browse/xdotool/examples/leftconsole.sh">examples/leftconsole.sh</a>.
This takes a selected window (by click) and hides it until the mouse hits the
left-side of the screen. The window will hide again when the mouse leaves the
window; the window will be full-height and slide in from the left. When hiding
it, it will slide left, off of the screen. If you run this and want to restore
the window, just ctrl+c the script, rerun it, and hit ctrl+c again before
clicking on a new window.

<p>

Changelist since previous announcement:
<pre>
2.20101012.*
  - New command: 'windowminimize' for minimizing windows.
  - New command: 'behave_screen_edge' to attach commands to edge and corner activities.
    For example, to lock your screen when the mouse hits the top-right corner
    for more than 2 seconds:
      xdotool behave_screen_edge --delay 2000 top-right exec xscreensaver-command -lock
    'xscreensaver-command' comes with the xscreensaver package.
  - New command: 'exec' for executing commands. Useful with behave_screen_edge.
  - Bug fix: Catch pointer grab failures in selectwindow (xdo_window_select)
    and abort if we can't grab it and report an error message.
  - Add  --delay and --repeat flags to click. This allows you to easily
    double-click (or more) in a single command. Requested by meenakshi sundaram
    via the mailing list.
  - Add new option to mouse move 'restore'. This will restore the mouse position
    to the last known position prior to the most recent move. That is:
      xdotool mousemove 0 0 mousemove restore
    the above will move the mouse to 0,0 then move the mouse back to the
    position it was before. Requested by luc le rumeur and suffian amjad on the
    mailing list.
  - Add 'static' and 'install-static' targets. Requested by Anthony
    Thyssen on the mailing list.
  - Fix bug in xdotool getmouselocation that didn't search for the client window
    correctly.
  - New function: xdo_mousewindow, which lets you get the window the mouse is
    currently over.
  - New function: xdo_mouselocation2, which is an extended version of
    xdo_mouselocation and includes the window the mouse is currently over.
  - New function: xdo_window_minimize, which minimizes a window.
  - Add patch from Henning Bekel that greatly improves xdotool's script
    feature. Scripts now no longer invoke /bin/sh for each line, but instead
    build a command chain to execute. Further, positional arguments ($1, $2,
    etc) and environment variables ($FOO, $WINDOWID, etc) work as expected
    despite the removal of /bin/sh.
