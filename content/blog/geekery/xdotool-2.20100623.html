The latest release of xdotool includes a few bug fixes, minor improvements, and
one major feature addition. All of the tests pass in the test suite (156
tests, 1892 assertions, 126 seconds).


<p>

The major feature is the new command chaining. That is, you can use multiple
commands from the same xdotool invocation. Any window querying (search,
getactivewindow, getwindowfocus) will save the result for use with future
commands on the same invocation. For a simple example, we can resize the
current window by doing this:

<pre>
% xdotool getactivewindow windowsize 600 400
</pre>

You can also activate the first Firefox window found:

<pre>
% xdotool search --class firefox windowactivate
</pre>

Or move all gimp windows to a specific desktop and then activate (switch to) gimp:
<pre>
% xdotool search --class gimp set_desktop_for_window %@ 2 windowactivate %@

# the "%@" means all windows found in the search. The default when you do not
# specify a window is always "%1" aka the first window found by the search.
</pre>

This idea for this feature came primarily from detailed suggestions by Henning
Bekel. Huge thanks for dumping ideas my way :)

<p>

In addition, libxdo is now documented with Doxygen and is available <a
href="http://semicomplete.com/files/xdotool/docs/html/">here</a>. Remember, if
you have a feature request, it can't hurt to ask (or send patches!). If I have
time/energy to work on it, I'll do what I can.

Changelist from previously-announced release:

<pre>
2.20100623.*:
  - Added 'window stack' and 'command chaining' support. Basically lets you
    include multiple commands on a single xdotool invocation and saves the last
    window result from search, getactivewindow, and getwindowfocus. For example,
    the default window selector is "%1" meaning the first window. 'xdotool
    search --class xterm windowsize 500 500' will resize the first xterm found.
    All commands that take window arguments (as flags or otherwise) now default to
    "%1" if unspecified. See xdotool(1) manpage sections 'COMMAND CHAINING'
    and 'WINDOW STACK' for more details. This feature was suggested (with great
    detail) by Henning Bekel.
  - To simplify command chaining, all options now terminate at the first
    non-option argument. See getopt(3) near 'POSIXLY_CORRECT' for details.
  - Add --sync support to windowsize.
  - Update docs and output to indicate that 'search --title' is deprecated (but
    still functions). Use --name instead.
  - Fix mousemove --screen problem due to bug in XTEST. Reported by
    Philipp Specht, http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=35
  - Fix segfault when invoking xdotool with an invalid command.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=34
    Reported by: Bruce Jerrick, Sven Lankes, Daniel Kahn Gillmor, and Thomas
    Schwery.
  - Fix bug --clearmodifiers bug caused by an uninitialized value being
    interpreted as the 'modmask' causing us to try to clear invalid modifiers.
    Reported by Hong-Leong Ong on the mailing list.
  - Lots of internal refactoring and documentation improvements.
  - Testing additions for several commands in addition to command chaining.
  - Documented libxdo through xdo.h. Docs can be generated by 'make docs'
    from the xdotool release.
  - libxdo: xdo_window_translate_with_sizehint
  - libxdo: xdo_window_wait_for_size
