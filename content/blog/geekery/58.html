mailfilter (my new mailreader for nmh) got a fairly important upgrade today. I added in both screen support and better pgp handling.<br>
Screen is supported if you want to use it, see SCREEN_POLICY in the script.<br>
Mail starting with <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----</code> will now be sent through <code>pgp_verify_command</code> much in the same way that <code>multipart/signed</code> (pgp signature attachment) mail is.<br>
<br>
So that was how I spent 4 hours this morning (among other projects...)
