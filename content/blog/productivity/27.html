the ! command is awesome. It lets you filter a given number of lines (or characters) through an external program. Here's an example: Let's say we have a file that has blank lines on it and we want to remove those blank lines? Here's what the file I made looks like:
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F8F8FF" width="50%">
<tr><td><pre style="border-left:0px; border:1px solid #BABACC; padding:1px; margin-left:0px">
Hello there

How are you



Plz kthx?

</pre></td></tr>
</table>

So, we want those blank lines gone, right? We can use the ! command with grep to do that! Type this:<br>
<span class=description>!Ggrep -v '^$'</span><br>
<br>
Now we're set, the result should look like this:

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F8F8FF" width="50%">
<tr><td><pre style="border-left:0px; border:1px solid #BABACC; padding:1px; margin-left:0px">
Hello there
How are you
Plz kthx?
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
