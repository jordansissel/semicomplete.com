I almost always listen to music. I've mentiond this before, but I was reminded
tonight of how music seems to make projects happen quicker; especially school
projects. Tonight I was working on my Algorithms class project (spanning tree
stuff) and found that I was working better than normal. This is due to my
finally having found some music to put in my laptop and listen to.

<p>

Rochester radio is the absolute definition of excessive repetition. Of the 11
stations I have programmed into my receiver, none of them were playing a
refreshing list of songs I hadn't heard in a while. So I put in a Nightwish cd
and listened to that instead. Productivity increased.

<p>

Assuming the following theories:
<br>
Music = Productivity <br>
Xterms = Productivity <br>

<p>

If you increase xterms and the quality of music, how much can we increase productivity by? ;)

<p>

Music may work well for me because I tend to get distracted or bored easily
when doing required tasks such as school work. If there's music playing I like,
then I'll end up distracting myself momentarily with the music instead of other
more time-consuming tasks such as reading news/blogs. Either way, music works.

<p>

Makes me wonder how many other people do the same thing?
