So rather than start writing my own indent function, I decided to read more
about <code>cindent</code>. The option, <code>cinoptions</code>, lets you tell
vim how to react to things. What I was looking for was:<br>
When I am typing a function call, and break the line because it's too long, I'd
like the new line to start aligned with the open parenthesis, like this:<p>
<pre>
System.out.println("Hello there, how are you? kthx." + 
                   "Java is fun");
		   <b>^</b>
</pre>
<br>
I want vim to automatically indent to the column position marked by the caret, <b>^</b> - 
Turns out vim has this functionality already (duh, it has almost evrything).<p>
<pre>:set cinoptions=(0</pre>
<br>
This, when <code>cindent</code> is enabled, will cause vim to auto indent to
match your parentheses usage.
