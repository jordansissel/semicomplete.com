The default handling of pageup and pagedown by xterm under Xsun is annoying.
When you hit page up in xterm, it scrolls up. This behavior is undesirable and
different from what I'm used to using. So, Xresources to the rescue.<p>

Xterm supports a number of options including keybindings, here's my fix. This 
will send a "page up" or "page down" character sequence to your terminal if you 
hit page up or page down, respectively. Shift+pageup still works as expected 
(actually scrolls)<p>

<pre>
! Override default action when hitting pageup and pagedown - actually
! send the ANSI code for page up
*VT100.translations: #override \n\
	~Shift &lt;Key&gt;Prior: string(0x1b) string("[5~") \n\
	~Shift &lt;Key&gt;Next: string(0x1b) string("[6~") \n
</pre>
<br>
Put that in your .Xresources and load it with:
<p>
<pre>
xrdb -merge .Xresources
</pre>
<p>
This file should get loaded automatically when you login through dtlogin, but
I haven't tested this yet.
