For some time I've been wanting to be able to pop open a small
split-pane in vim to run simple commands like, oh.. I don't know.. javac
and such. Just for temporary, quick shell access.<br>
Tonight, as I was browsing through the screen manpage, I saw that screen
allowed you to split the window into different regions. Using this and a
quick vim key mapping, I was able to do it without much trouble!<p>

The vim keymapping:<br>
<pre>
map \s :silent !screener.sh&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>

Contents of screener.sh
<pre>
screen -X split
screen -X focus down
screen -X screen sh -c "cd $PWD; $SHELL; screen -X remove"
</pre>
<br>

Thanks to screen being smart, you don't have to specify what screen
session to send these commands to, which made it 10000% easier, as we
don't have to bother trying to figure out which screen session is
running vim. You could optionally add a <code>:!screen -X resize
&lt;whatever&gt;</code> before to resize the lower frame to a specific size.
See the screen manpage for more information on how to use <code>screen
-X</code> and the <code>resize</code> command.<p>

The results of hitting <code>\s</code> in vim can be found in the screenshot on the right. After logging out of that shell, the newly-split screen disappears and returns you to your original, full-screen vim.
