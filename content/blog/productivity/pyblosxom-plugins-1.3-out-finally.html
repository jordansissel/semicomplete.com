Subject says it all. I've really wanted comments working in pyblosxom 1.3 for quite some time. However, all googling points to old versions of the comments plugin that only works on the older versions. I checked the pyblosxom page tonight and was pleasantly surprised that a contributed plugin set had been released early this month.

If you use pyblosxom 1.3.x, plugin updates are ready for your use.

On that note, comment functionality is FINALLY here on this site. To those of you reading this site, feel free to comment! I love feedback.
