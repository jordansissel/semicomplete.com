I got tired of losing my terminal sessions whenever I decided I needed to
restart X for some reason, or one of my assclown dorm-mates decides to
ctrl+alt+backspace my X session. So, instead of enabling <code>DontZap</code>
in my XF86Config, I figured I would just use screen to compensate. This wasn't
enough, seeing as <code>xterm -e screen</code> would just start up a new screen
session completely ignoring the current detached ones and thus defeating the
purpose of using screen for convenience. Thus, I wrote a two line script to fix
this problem:
<br>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

SESSION=`screen -ls | grep '(Detached)$' | sed -ne '1p' | awk '{print $1}'`
[ -z "$SESSION" ] && screen || screen -x "$SESSION"
</pre>
<br>
What this does is look for the first detached screen session listed by
<code>screen -ls</code> and use it to attach to. If there are no
currently-detached screen sessions running it'll start up a new one and running
your default shell.
<p>
Ok, so how is this useful? Put the script above in a file called "attach" and throw it in ~/bin/ (make that directory if you have to). Make sure you <code>chmod 755 ~/bin/attach</code>! Now change the way you open terminals in your windowmanager to:
<pre>
xterm <u>-e ~/bin/attach</u> [other xterm opts here] 
</pre>
<br>
And you're good to go :)
