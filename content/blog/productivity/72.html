So with much a-fiddling, I discovered that you can create floating workspaces with the default keybinding "F9" - At the prompt, "Go to or create workspace: " enter WFloatWS:&lt;workspace name&gt; where &lt;workspace name&gt; can be anything. Hitting F2 starts up my friend, xterm, on this new floating workspace. <p>
I haven't yet figured out how to create empty <code>WFloatFrame</code>s, but I'm working on it. It seems that if the parent frame has only one child you can't cfocus the parent until the child is dead.<p>
That is:
<pre>
WIonWS
  |
  +---> WIonFrame
    |
    +----> WFloatWS
</pre>
You can't give focus to the WIonFrame until WFloatWS either is destroyed or moved outside of the frame. I'm sure there's a way around this.
