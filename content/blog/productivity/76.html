I love my laptop keyboard and mouse nipple. I love them lots, and since my
desktop keyboard is kinda borked right now (some keys don't work all the time)
I decided I'd use x2x from my laptop -> my desktop. My destop also has x2x from
it to my ultra1.<br>

If the mouse from my laptop is being sent to the desktop currently, then I can
use the desktop's mouse to go to the ultra1's head and use mouse+keyboard
there...<br>
so I end up using laptop keyboard + desktop mouse on the ultra1.. haha <3 x2x
