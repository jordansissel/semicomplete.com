I'm in the process of porting keynav to Windows. I've never programmed in
Visual Studio before, but I think it's going quite well considering I've never
coded for this platform. 

<p>
The current total lines of code is 277. I expect it to be about this number once I'm finished.

I'm writing it using Visual C++ Express, a free version of Visual Studio. Free (after free registration). From Microsoft. Very cool :)

So far I have screen splitting working correctly. My clip code is kinda borked.
After I fix that, it should be completely trivial to add mouse movement calls.
Since Windows doesn't typically use sloppy focus, I think I'll add extra code
to figure out what window the mouse is over and give that window focus.
