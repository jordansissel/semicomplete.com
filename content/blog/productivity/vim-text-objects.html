Read about text objects in vim with <code>:help text-objects</code>

<p/>

Text objects are basically direction macros for simple deletion/copy/changing. For instance, 

<code> diB </code>

This will delete everything between the nearest { and closing }. That is:

<pre>
static int update() {
	if (u) {
		printf("Update\n");
	} else {
		printf("No update\n";
	}
}
</pre>

Paste the above code in vim. Put the cursor on the first printf (line 3) and,
in command mode, do <code>diB</code> - undo that and try <code>ciB</code>. The
<code>d</code> command will delete the code block, where as <code>c</code> will
do the obvious and delete the code block and leave you in insert mode.

<p/>

These text object direction things are quite neat. Again, check out the help
page on it (<code>:help text-objects</code>). Neat little shortcuts.
