I use cindent in vim. cindent is very useful. However, it breaks a lot of the
time, especially when not in C-style languages (perl, etc). It indents "how I
want" 90% of the time, the other 10% it does it incorrectly or when I don't
want it to so.

<p/>

If I can find time tomorrow, I'd like to write a few magic-indentation
keybindings so I can easily do certain kinds of indentation the way I want, and
only when I want. Most of the time, autoindent is all I need anyway.

<p/>

I'll post any scripts I come up with here when they're done.
