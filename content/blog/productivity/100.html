My hatred for other people's indenting habbits has now been calmed by the awesomeness that is vim. The command, <i>=</i>, will let you reindent the current line (or the whole file, or whatever) to the settings you use in vim already.<br>
So, instead of dealing with people being dumb and using spaces for *everything* this magical keystroke series will fix my woes:<br>
<pre>1G=G</pre>
This will cause reindentation of every line in the file you are editing.<p>

Woot.
