I'm almost done and graduated from RIT, which is why I haven't posted about
anything recently. Finally done with this school. Wee!

<p>

Some noise woke me up from my pleasant slumber, and I can't seem to get back to
sleep, so I might aswell do some thinking.

<p>

I think grok's config syntax is far too cluttered. I would much rather make it
more simplified, somehow. Something like:

<pre>
file /var/log/auth.log: syslog
{blockuser, t=3, i=60} Invalid user %USER% from %IP%

file /var/log/messages: syslog
{tracksudo, prog=su} BAD SU %USER:F% to %USER:T% on %TTY%

reaction blockuser "pfctl -t naughty -T add %IP%"
reaction tracksudo "echo '%USER:F% failed su. (to %USER:T%)' &gt;&gt; /var/log/su.log"
</pre>

Seems like it's less writing than the existing version. Less writing is good. A
more relaxed syntax would be nicer aswell -such as not requiring quotes around
filenames.

<p>

This new syntax also splits reaction definitions from pattern matches, allowing
you to call reactions from different files and other matches. I'll be keepin
the perlblock and other features that reactions have, becuase they are quite
useful.

<p>

I've also come up with a simple solution to reactions that execute shell
commands. The current version of grok will run <code>system("your
command")</code> every time a shell reaction is run. This is tragicaly
suboptimal due to startup overhead. The simple solution is to run 
<code>"/bin/sh -"</code> so that there is already a shell accepting standard
input and waiting for my commands. Simply write the shell command to that
program.

<p>

I wrote a short program to test the speed of using <code>system()</code> vs
printing to the input of a shell. You can view the <a
href="http://www.semicomplete.com/scripts/testsh.pl">testsh.pl script</a> and
the <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/scripts/testsh.prof.out">profiled
output</a>.

<p>

An abbreviated form of the profiled output follows:

<pre>
%Time    Sec.     #calls   sec/call  F  name
92.24    1.5127     1000   0.001513     main::sys
 2.04    0.0335     1000   0.000033     main::sh
</pre>

sys() calls system(), where sh() simply sends data to an existing shell
process. The results speak for themselves, even though this example is only
running "echo" - the startup time of the shell is obviously a huge factor in
runtime. The difference is incredible. I am definitely implementing this in the
next version of grok. I've already run into many cases where I am processing
extremely large logs post-hoc and I end up using perl block reactions to speed
up execution. This shell execution speed-up will help make grok even faster,
and it can always use more speed.

<p>

Still no time to work on projects right now, perhaps soon! I'm moving to
California in less than a week, so this will have to wait until after the move.
