So yeah - I was explaining the beauties of cindent and folding in vim to a werkt today and when I went back to my room decided to pull up the help on cindent, etc. Looked at <code>indentexpr</code> and decided I needed to learn more vim. What <code>indentexpr</code> lets you do is set a vim function (Or perl/python/ruby) tell vim how much to indent.<p>

More on this later after I write a vim script to do exactly what I want...
