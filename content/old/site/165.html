I got bored today and wrote a quick script to start/stop a ppp over ssh vpn. I'm working on an article on how to get ppp over ssh working for freebsd, so that'll be up shortly. I've also been working on a few new upgrades to logwatch, i'll commit those as soon as they're completed.
</p>

<pre>
% ifconfig ndis0
ndis0: [snip...]
        inet 129.21.112.158 netmask 0xffffff80 broadcast 129.21.112.255
        media: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet autoselect (DS/11Mbps)
        status: associated
        ssid baccus 1:baccus
        channel 11 authmode OPEN powersavemode OFF powersavesleep 100
</pre>

As you can see, I'm currently using wireless on some random access point
I associated to called <i>baccus</i>. I don't know who's access point
this is, but it's what ndis0 insists on associating with, so I don't
complain. Being on a school campus is, in my opinion, one of the most
potentially dangerous networks you can put your computer on. Here you'll
have an assortment of geeks of varying clue levels - pretty much anyone
with half a brain can sniff all the wireless traffic they want.
</p>
<p>
Having my traffic sniffed isn't really annoying until I want to login
someplace that insists on clear-text passwords (say, thefacebook.com).
So, I have gotten into the habbit of using OpenSSH's SOCKS5 proxy to do
that, but it's annoying starting a proxy every time I need one. What can
I do instead?
</p>
<p>
A quick solution that is very simple is to tunnel PPP over SSH. I won't
go into the details here, but the short of it is this: I have a ppp
tunnel to one of my machines in my dorm room which is on a wired,
switched network I consider to be trusted. Then, all of my traffic can
possibly be tunneled to a safe network where it will then go forth and
be happy.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, I'll be posting an article on how to make this go shortly.
