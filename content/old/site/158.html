My site is pretty much my ramblings, ideas, and projects regarding
various computer technologies. I've always written my own website
software myself becuase I needed features I couldn't find in blogging
tools available at the time I was writing the code. 
<p/>
This time around, however, is a different story. There are plenty of
blogware suites out there that have a varying array of features. A
friend of mine recently started using Wordpress over his own software.
I've checked it out and it's decent. However, it does simply blogging
and little more by default. I need to explore more of it's options and
i'll have to write a few of my own plugins, but it may be what I need.
<p>
Most of the work redesigning my current website has been regarding
layout and extra content features. These being, specifically, cvs and
darcs commit summaries, Furthermore, I tend to do one of many things,
projects and blog entries. These are two different things, in my
opinion. I need to be able to update project pages along with being able
to write simple entries.
<p>
Wordpress seems to have these abilities via plugins and whatnot. So I'm
going to be spending some time trying to configure it and write a few
plugins so I can have various informations displayed on the front page,
such as cvs and darcs repo commits, etc.
<p>
The search goes on, but for now we'll have to see how Wordpress fairs
against my tests. Since Wordpress already meets one of my requirements,
that it allows me to post things. It also has a plugin framework and
themability, etc. I need a developer blog. And for me to consider using
Wordpress I'm going to need to hack some functionality into it. So we'll
see :)
