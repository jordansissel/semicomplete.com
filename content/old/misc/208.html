AJAX lets you send requests using HTTP GET or POST. POST is useful if you have
*lots* of data you may want to transmit or want to transmit in a specific data
format such as XMLRPC, SOAP, or JSON.

<p/>

Assuming I can find time among my many projects, I'd like to do a study of each
of the client-to-server and server-to-client communication mechanisms and come
to some general conclusions as to what communication schemes are better than
others and for what purposes. Hopefully, the end result will be some general rules for deciding which communication protocols you should use and why :)
