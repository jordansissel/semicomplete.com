I bought my first few songs on itunes tonight. Easy process, but it's yet
another apple product I don't fit into :(

<p>

For a full album in the store, I pay $8 to $14 for a CD, assuming I buy it brand new from Best Buy or another retailer. On iTunes, I pay $10 on most albums. In a second-hand music store, I'd pay somewhere around $3 to $9 for the same music.

<p>

Let's assume (correctly) that I'm not buying a CD for the purposes of ripping it and sharing it on bittorrent.

<p>

What am I gaining by using iTunes? Not much. If I ever lose the music I have to
repurchase it (from what I understand), which mirrors exactly the issues of
losing a physical CD. I'm additionally locked in to Apple as a vendor as soon
as I purchase a song. Furthermore, for practically the same exact price, I get
music with less quality and more restrictions. How does this make sense? Given
that "less quality" and "more restrictions" automatically devalue a product
compared to the same product without those problems, why does this business
model succeed?

<p>

I'm not an audiophile, so CD vs 128kbit doesn't make me upset, but I do like to
copy my music around. I have basically three places where I listen to music. My
iphone, my house, and my office. All of my music is at my house. Some of my
music is on my iphone, and none of my music is at my office. I can stream
music from my house to my office, but only if it's in a format playable at my
office, which usually means drm-free data so things like mplayer and xmms can
consume it.

<p>

Only some songs are available in "iTunes plus" - an option to download
higher-quality and drm-free music, and nothing I've downloaded today is
available that way.

<p>

Even if you considered Amazon's MP3 service, it's still a better value to buy
the damn CD and rip it yourself. Ripping a cd is a one-click action these days
on every platform available, so where's the cost justification in these online
services pricing their data at or above what I pay in a store? :(
