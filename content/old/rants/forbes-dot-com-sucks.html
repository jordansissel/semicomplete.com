I followed a webclip link out of gmail today and it dropped me off at a news
story on Forbes.com. I wanted to read this story. However, I was presented with
something horrific.  I was presented with the results of a tragic effort that I
can only presume is a scheme to show as many "punch the monkey" advertisements
as possible.

<p>

What is this scheme? Well. I landed on the page. This page had two
average-length paragraphs. No sooner had I finished reading the first paragraph
than the page reloaded and showed me another, new piece of text. 

<p>

Six seconds later. A new page.

<p>

Repeat.

<p>

Turns out Forbes.com has some sort of slideshow they try to use to display
stories. To make matters worse, there are advertisements everywhere. By the time I
figured out what part of the page I was supposed to be looking at, it went to
the next page. Sure, you can stop the slideshow, but I only found that out afterwards.

<p>

Thanks Forbes. I almost read one of your stories.
