I've been comfortable with my assumption that ion was lacking in a way to do floating workspaces and windows and had groomed my desktop enviroment to fit this assumption. However, yesterday as I was poking around in the various lua config files I saw how to create floating workspaces.<p>

From what little bit I've played with this feature you can do a ton of crazy cool things (From simply having a full-screen floating workspace to attaching a floating workspace to an existing WIonFrame.)<p>

Mad kudos to Tuomo for writing such a kick ass window manager. I'm going to produce some documentation soon on how to use Lua in Ion and a brief introduction on the floatws module and how to use it.
