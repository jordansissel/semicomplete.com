Using at(8), I can schedule jobs to occur, say, when I need to wake up.

<pre>
nightfall(~) % atq
Date                            Owner           Queue   Job#
Thu Jul 13 07:30:00 PDT 2006    jls             c       14
Thu Jul 13 08:00:00 PDT 2006    jls             c       15
Thu Jul 13 08:20:00 PDT 2006    jls             c       16
</pre>

All of those jobs run my 'wakeup.sh' script which is somewhat primitive, but it
does the job.
