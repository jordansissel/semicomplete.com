I've finally taken the plunge with puppet's exported resources.

<p>

"Exported resources" is a feature of puppet that allows your nodes to export
resources to other nodes. You can read more about this feature on <a
href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Exported_Resources">puppet's
exported resources documentation</a>. Covering how to setup exported resources
or storeconfigs is out of scope, but if you need help read the docs and come to
#puppet on freenode IRC.

<p>

Exported resources are pretty cool, but they lack one important feature -
expiration/purging. The storeconfigs database has no idea about nodes
that you have decommissioned or repurposed, so it's very possible to leave
exported resources orphaned in your database.

<p>

I worked around this by making my resources such that I can expire them. This
is done by making a custom define that has a 'timestamp' field that defaults to
now, when registering each time. If a node has not checked in (and updated its
resources) recently, I will consider that resource expired and will purge it.

<p>

I made a demo of this and put the code on github: <a
href="https://github.com/jordansissel/puppet-examples/tree/master/exported-expiration/">jordansissel/puppet-examples/exported-expiration</a>.
More details (and example output of multiple runs with expiration)  are available in the <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/puppet-examples/blob/master/exported-expiration/README.rdoc">README</a>.

<p>

The demo is runnable by itself (standalone, no puppet master), so you can test
it without needing to mess with your own puppet installations.
