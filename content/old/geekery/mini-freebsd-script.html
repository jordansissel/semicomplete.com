I wrote a script a while ago to build a very tiny freebsd world. It's extremely
fast and only builds a freebsd image in approximately 10 megs of space. It lets you quickly create new jail enviroments or system images for small embedded platforms.

<p>

If you look at the script itself, you'll get an idea of what it installs. I
used a variant of this script to build the system I run on my Soekris net4501
which runs FreeBSD and is under 20 megs.

<p>

There are lots of "make a small freebsd system" scripts, but most of the ones
I've found rely heavily on 'buildworld' and what not. This takes a live system
and copies the binaries you need, then uses ldd(1) to track down required
libraries.

<p>

<a href="/scripts/minibsd.sh">view minibsd.sh</a>

<p>

Example usage:
<pre>
kenya(~/t) % rm -rf ./soekris/
kenya(~/t) % time sudo ./minibsd.sh
sudo ./minibsd.sh   0.16s user 0.65s system 61% cpu 1.326 total
kenya(~/t) % sudo chroot ./soekris /bin/sh
# pwd
/
# exit
</pre>

Simple jail config (rc.conf):
<pre>
jail_enable="YES"
jail_list="test"
jail_test_rootdir="/home/jls/t/soekris"
jail_test_hostname="test"
jail_test_ip="10.1.1.1"
jail_test_interface="tl1"
</pre>

Put something simple in this jail's rc.conf (/home/jls/t/soekris/etc/rc.conf):

<pre>
sshd_enable="YES"
sendmail_enable="NONE"
</pre>

Let's test the jail now:
<pre>
kenya(~/t) % sudo /etc/rc.d/jail start
Configuring jails:.
Starting jails: 
</pre>

At this point, it's probably hung (assuming you enabled sshd). If you hit
CTRL+T you'll see what command  has the foreground and what it's doing.* This is
because it's prompting you (output is directed to JAILROOT/var/log/console.log)
for entropy for the ssh-keygen. Smash a few keys then hit enter. It'll finish
eventually.

<pre>
kenya(~/t) % sockstat -4 | grep 10.1.1.1:22 
root     sshd       2258  3  tcp4   10.1.1.1:22           *:*
</pre>

Our sshd is running happily inside that jail we made. This whole process took
about 5 minutes.

<p>

* FreeBSD's CTRL+T terminal handler feature has to be the best thing ever
invented. I wish Linux had something like this. Here's what hitting CTRL+T when
running cat looks like:

<pre>
kenya(~) % cat
load: 0.45  cmd: cat 2324 [ttyin] 0.00u 0.00s 0% 600k
load: 0.42  cmd: cat 2324 [ttyin] 0.00u 0.00s 0% 600k
</pre>

It clearly shows you the command name, the pid, and the syscall-type-thing it's
doing. Clearly cat is waiting for input from the tty. <3 FreeBSD.
