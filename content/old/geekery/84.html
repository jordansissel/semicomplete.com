The 2nd annual Redbull Coding Competition was held here at RIT, and oh was it awesome. 12 straight hours of teams of 3-5 people coding in various languages trying to attain one of the given <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/redbull/objs.php">objectives</a> and while consuming <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~psionic/images/redbull.jpg">insane amounts of redbull</a>.<p>

My team went to work with perl and we pushed out a half-decent graphical filebrowser and our remote team-member, pete, finished up the compression objective in record time. The whole competition was a hell of a lot of fun.<p>

<3 perl.
