<a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com">Sysadvent 2009</a> is upon us. First
article is online as of now.

<p>

This year's been much more pleasant to plan. There are many more people helping
out this year, so I get to relax more and work at a much more sane pace.

<p>

Special thanks to <a href="http://standalone-sysadmin.com/">Matt</a> for being
a driving force in wrangling up new volunteers, and certainly to all the folks
helping out this year.
