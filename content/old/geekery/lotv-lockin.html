This October will bring a 48-hour hackathon organized by the 
<a href="http://www.leagueoftechvoters.org/drupal/">
League of Technical Voters</a>. If you can find your way to Austin, Texas in
mid October, then you should sign up and be there. 

<p>

If you know PHP, then you can probably help code. If you don't know PHP, but know how to code, and still want to help, you can probably still help code! If you don't program, but still want to help out, you can do that too!

<p>

The goal of the hackathon seems to be development of Drupal modules to aid the
league site in becoming a meaningful and useful portal for political
discussion.
