Full changelist since previously-announced release:

<pre>
1.20100227.*:
  - Bump major version since there were lots of libxdo changes (now libxdo.so.1)
  - Support '--pid NUM' for searching for windows by pid:
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=10
    Example: xdotool search --pid 12345
    Example: xdotool search --pid 12345 "hello world"
  - Add 'xdotool getwindowpid' command to get the pid that owns a window.
  - Add --window to xdotool mousemove, click, mousedown, and mouseup
  - Add --screen to xdotool mousemove
  - The --clearmodifiers flag now clears mouse buttons, too.
    Part of http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=6
  - The --clearmodifiers flag now clears caps lock.
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=4
  - Have 'make install' create all required directories
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=17
  - Support multiple screens in searches. Default is to search all screens.
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=11
    Example: 'xdotool search --screen N' specifies a single screen to search.
  - Support reading a list of xdotool commands via stdin or a file. Usages:
    * read from stdin:
      xdotool -
    * read from stdin (use isatty(0) to detect redirection):
      xdotool < somefile
    * An executable script also works when it has this at the top:
      #!/path/to/xdotool

0.20100118.*:
  - Slight change in how we present versions. Now versions have major, date,
    and svn revision. The main addition was to add the major which maps to the
    libxdo library abi version (libxdo.so.0).
  - Add 'xdotool version' for querying version
  - libxdo now has xdo_version function for fetching the library version.
  - Allow typing keys that are not mapped to any keyboard button.
    For example, you can type the euro symbol like this, even if you don't have
    a key on your keyboard that can do it:
      xdotool key EuroSign
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=16
  - Fixed some pod errors in the manpage
