I've been maintaining my own repository(s) for years, and I've finally grown
out of doing it.

<p>

My first major
<a href="/blog/geekery/merging-multiple-svn-repos.html">repository move</a> was
to merge all my CVS and Subversion repositories into a single Subversion
repository. This move made me happy for a while, but from time to time the
machine hosting the repository would go down, and I'd be out of Subversion
access for a while. Additionally, the machine hosting this repository grants me
only a small quota (500mb) and my subversion repository was occupying 10% of
the space. Lastly, I couldn't be bothered to setup webdav+svn, so I couldn't
grant arbitrary users (like you) proper read (and perhaps write) access.

<p>

To solve all of these problems, in part or in full, I created a new project on
googlecode called 'semicomplete' for my repository.  All of my projects will
now live there.

<p>

I used svnsync to upload my local repository so as to keep all the change
history, which took 5 hours, but was otherwise painless.

<p>

New repository: 
<a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/">http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/</a>

<p>

As a side bonus, Google Code Hosting allows you to publish "downloads", which
means all of my releases can be put here, saving me 24 megs of used quota on
the old machine. Further bonuses include an issue tracking system (so you and I
can file bugs that won't get lost) and a project wiki. I don't know if I'll use
the wiki yet.

<p>
