I've been on the fence about getting a new system for many many months now. I
finally caved. It was a bit more than I wanted to pay, but it'll be worth it.
It'll be running vmware server and a pile of virtual machines, all in the name
of doing more with less.  Stats:

<p>
Two dual core Opteron 270, 4GB ram, 
<a href="http://www.tyan.com/product_board_spec.aspx?pid=151">tyan thunder k8we</a>,
three 500gb sata 3gb/s drives (who doesn't need 1.5T of storage?), and a 
<a href="http://www.antec.com/Detail.bok?no=449">fancy antec case</a>.

<p>

It's been 6+ years since I've purchased computer hardware, so there was much
learning to be had. Since I intend on running vmware server on this, I really
wanted one of the new Intel chips that had virtualization. I also wanted two
dual core processors. So, I found a nice Xeon 3000 that suited my price and
power needs, but it turns out nobody makes dual-socket motherboards for Xeon
3000-series. Intel's website explicitly says thes are single-processor systems
only. Sigh. Stupid Intel, they'd have my money now if they didn't make that
(bad) decision.

<p>

So, the next chip up is the Xeon 5000-series. These processors are more than
twice the cost of a Xeon 3000-series, and are very not worth it to me just to
have virtualization. That pushed me towards AMD. I looked at benchmarks and
features and ended uplooking at AMD's dual core Opteron line. Opteron 275's
were at my price point, but the best price was at Newegg and they were sold
out. Opteron 270's were $30ish cheaper, and only 200mhz slower, so I bought two
of them. If I'm feeling adventurous, I'll overclock them and save myself time
and $60, right? ;)

<p>

I'm really looking forward to having some new hardware. Wee!

<p>

On another note, I surfed the internets looking for items of need, reviews, and
prices. Everything I found was either only $5 cheaper than newegg, or the
cheapest was at newegg. I heart newegg. 6ish years ago, that's where I bought
my 1.4gHz, then-nearly-top-of-the-line system. I'm glad to see they're still
around and doing quite well.
