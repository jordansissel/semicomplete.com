<a href="/blog/geekery/firefox-urleditor-hackery.html">Last week</a>, I posted
about a new firefox extension I was working on that would let you edit the contents of the urlbar more easily. Well, I have good news. It's alive.

<p>

The current incarnation is very basic, but I have some ideas for how to extend
it in the future. I won't go into that now.

<p>

This extension adds a menu item to the context menu in the url bar labeled
'Edit URL'. This will bring up a dialog box with a table of key-value pairs
listed. You can edit, add, or delete entries. Clicking 'OK' will modify the url
based on your changes. It automatically unescapes values and re-escapes them later.
