Lots of people are here. The venue is huge compared to BarCamp NYC's
venue, which is great considering the number of people in attendance.

<p>

The People:
There are quite a few people I know here, which is surprising
considering I've only been in the area for 3 weeks. Some BarCamp NYC
attendees, coworkers, and a friend from Yahoo, so far. I initially
started helping with sign-in so I met lots of folks at the door. Later
time was spent wandering around and chatting about various interests.
Meeting new folks is definitely still not my forte, but I seem to be
doing decently. The two folks I know from BarCamp NYC recognized me by
my pajamas. I tried to find a photo of said event with my pajamas
featured but Flickr doesn't seem to let you search by comments. At any
rate, there's a lot of people in attendance so the next two days should
be quite fun. There's a few VCs here, marketing and other types. On the
whole, there's mostly geeks. The type of geek ranges from high-up
engineers to self-employed consultants to I-just-do-this-in-my-free-time
hackers.

The Venue: Microsoft is this camp's host. The office is very large and
has a number of conference rooms. There are 8 presentation areas setup
for this camp.  That's probably more than is necessary, but more is
always better than less. It's ironic considering the location and the
openness of the event. That is, how the common view of Microsoft is of an
evil megacorp, while it is  the host to an incredibly successful open-style
conference. Thanks for the venue, Microsoft!

Between final exams, moving, situating with a new job at Google, etc, I
haven't had any time to work on new projects. Therefore, I don't really
have anything to present on. However, I'm considering having a BoF-type
session where we share ideas on computing productivity. I'm always
finding irritating barriers in software that have solutions available
but I don't know about them and don't seem to find them while searching.
We'll see.

<p>

Common interests seem to be Flock, Drupal, social networking, etc. Seems
like a similar set of interests and people as at BarCamp NYC. Have the
last 5 months sat idle amongst the "new software technology" community?
I can't tell, but I'm sure I'll find out tomorrow. Either way, I'm
looking forward to the presentations.

<p>
I'll poll tomorrow for feedback on what I probably should present on, but
current ideas are: anti-hype presentation discussing AJAX (what it is, what
it's not? where it may be going) or general productivity to find/share what
people use to make computing use easier.
