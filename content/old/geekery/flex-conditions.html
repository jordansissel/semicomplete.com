I finally (after a bit of searching and thinking) figured how to properly match
comments with flex/bison. Horray :)

<p>

Some tutorials use this in flex:

<pre>
#.*$
</pre>

But since flex chooses longest-match-first for the next token, any line with a
# in it might have the remainder of the line accidentally cut as a comment. The
right way to do this appears to be:

<pre>
/* in your .lex file */

%x LEX_COMMENT

%%

"#" { BEGIN(LEX_COMMENT); }
&lt;LEX_COMMENT&gt;[^\n]*  /* ignore comments. */
&lt;LEX_COMMENT&gt;\n   { yylineno++; BEGIN(INITIAL); } /* end comment */
</pre>

There's a mini state-machine going on here. When it matches a "#" it moves into
the 'LEX_COMMENT' (name chosen by me, could be anything) state where only
tokens in this state are accepted. Now my config files can ignore comments
properly: only when outside the presence of any other token (like a quoted
string).
