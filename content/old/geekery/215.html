Logwatcher got a few significant updates today.

<p>

You can now give subnames to patterns in the form of %PATTERN:NAME%. It'll
match against the named PATTERN but be referrable as %PATTERN:NAME% instead of just %PATTERN%. This is extremely useful if you have two instances of the same pattern in one match. Perl exec works again too.

<p>

I added debug levels too so it won't output anything less you want it to. Specify debug with -d, repeat for higher debug levels. You can also specify a nonstandard config file with -f path/to/file.

<p>

If you use logwatcher, let me know. I'm always up for adding new features.
