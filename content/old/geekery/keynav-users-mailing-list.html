I've been slightly overwhelmed with email about keynav in the past few days. To
help with this, I've created a mailing list for the project.

<p>

Email: keynav-users@googlegroups.com
Home: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/keynav-users">http://groups.google.com/group/keynav-users</a>

<p>

I'll post announcements there in addition to this site. Questions should be
directed to the mailing list. :)
