For the longest time I've found myself jotting notes in files tossed
throughout my home directory. Finding these files later has become a
chore and half.<br>
Some short while ago, the author of Ion, Tuomo Valkonen, wrote a little
program called riot in haskel. I got this to build *once* and only once,
so all future attempts to use this failed miserably. At any rate, riot
is a useful tool to make notes of things. It stores notes in mbox
format. All in all, a useful program, unless you can't get a haskell
compiler working for your OS!
<p>

I quickly became annoyed, realizing the folly of my ways, having to put
little jotted notes in various files that end up everywhere. Annoyed, I
created a solution in a project I called 'note.' It's a simple perl
Curses::UI interface to let me take notes and post followups in a
thread-like manner.

The config file needs to go in your home directory as
<code>~/.noterc</code>. The format of the file is:
<p>
<pre>
dbuser = DATABASE_USER
dbpass = DATABASE_PASSWORD
dbname = DATABASE_NAME
dbhost = DATABASE_HOST
</pre>
<br>
You'll need postgres and perl. Perl will need Curses::UI and
File::Temp<br>
I also have the sql you'll need to put in <a
href="/~psionic/projects/note/tables.sql">tables.sql</a>
