I found some time tonight to convert one of my slideshows to S5. It's not fully
done, but I have a working slideshow. It took about 5 lines of xslt different
from the presenter.xsl stylesheet to turn my slideshow stuff into S5. I still
need to learn about S5, but it seems to have many of the features I want - have
I mentioned this before? ;)

<p>

It's *much* slower than xmlpresenter when switching slides. I can move at many
slides-per-second with xmlpresenter and it takes 1-2 seconds to switch slides
with S5. However, I'm not sure 'slides-per-second' is even a meaningful metric
worth considering. Who does multiples slides in a second anyway? Still, I'm
concerned for the overall speed of the software if switching slides takes a
while.
