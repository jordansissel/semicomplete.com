Last year had some strange badges at Defcon, but they were fun. This year, they're even more full of technology (mini sd card reader, infrared stuff, and what looks like a usb mount point) and much less fun.

<p>

Although it is foolish for me to think another conference badge could be as
awesome as the

I think it's safe to conclude that Defcon's badges have jumped the shark,
because this year's badges are kind of stupid.
