I already know how to setup ldap databases and add objects. Now I needed to figure out how to secure it and hook it to kerberos.

<p/>
The following in my slapd.conf maps kerberos users to ldap objects.

<pre>
authz-regexp uid=([^,]*),cn=gssapi,cn=auth 
             "ldap:///ou=Users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu??sub?(uid=$1)"
</pre>

When you have kerberos ticket and authenticate using SASL, you will bind as 'uid=USER,cn=gssapi,cn=auth' - this is not the proper ldap object for any user on my system. Luckily, I can substitute this dn for a valid one using 'authz-regexp.' What this does, essentially, is do a subquery when you authenticate via SASL and looks for objects in the Users orgunit with a uid=USER. Very very helpful. Now I can get a kerberos ticket and ldap knows who I am:

<pre>
nightfall(~) [976] % kinit
psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU's Password: 
kinit: NOTICE: ticket renewable lifetime is 0
nightfall(~) [977] % ldapwhoami
SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
SASL username: psionic@CSH.RIT.EDU
SASL SSF: 56
SASL installing layers
dn:cn=jordan sissel,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
Result: Success (0)
</pre>

Wonderful! The next step was to allow users to modify their own objects. A short ACL entry in slapd.conf fixes that.

<pre>
access to attrs=gecos,description,loginShell,mail by self write
</pre>

This ACL ensures that users only have write access to themselves, and even then only to the attributes listed above. To test this, I did the following:

<pre>
nightfall(~) [981] % ldapsearch -Q -LLL '(uid=psionic)' 'loginShell'
dn: cn=Jordan Sissel,ou=Users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
loginShell: /test/baz/fizz

nightfall(~) [982] % cat myldif
dn: cn=jordan sissel,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
changetype: modify
replace: loginShell
loginShell: Happy Login Shell

nightfall(~) [983] % ldapmodify -Q -f myldif
modifying entry "cn=jordan sissel,ou=users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu"

ghtfall(~) [984] !1! % !ldapse
ldapsearch -Q -LLL '(uid=psionic)' 'loginShell'
dn: cn=Jordan Sissel,ou=Users,dc=csh,dc=rit,dc=edu
loginShell: Happy Login Shell

</pre>

Users have write access to their own objects now.

<p/>

The next step is going to be getting SSL/TLS working. I made a brief attempt at doing that tonight but I failed. Getting some SSLv3 handshake error that is clearly PEBCAK on my part. Oh well, sleep now. More LDAP later.
