Too many hotspot ISPs rely on unencrypted traffic and track authorized users by
mac address and/or ip address. Let's abuse this.

<p>

The simple way to abuse this is to set your ethernet and ip addresses to one
that you know has already been authorized by the captive portal system. Poof. Internet access.

<p>

How do we find one? Certainly it's simple to sniff traffic and find anyone able
to access the outside network, but it's a manual process. To automate it, I
wrote a simple script to do the discovery and testing automatically. 

<p>

I figured a tmobile hotspot was the perfect place to try this. I change my mac
address and flush my browser cookies, and now I look like a new, potential
customer to the captive portal. After I verify I cannot get outside of the
local network, I ran my new little script. It worked by finding another person
on the wireless network who was authorized to go online and then set my
ethernet and ip addresses accordingly. Yay internet.

<p>

This particular script will only work in FreeBSD, but can easily be fixed to
work in Linux or another OS.

This is the output from running it on the network at my house.
