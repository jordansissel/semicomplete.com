So regarding a 6 line feature of pimp I *never* thought I'd ever use and wrote
in just because I wanted to see how many lines it would take me to do a
shoutcast server-ey thing... I'm using it. I don't have a long enough audio
cable to reach my receiver from my desktop, but I do have one that reaches from
kenya (my server). Since my desktop has pimp and I'm too lazy to set it up on
kenya, I run pimp on my desktop andhave an mplayer instance from kenya connect
to it. Crazy useful :)<p>

I'm seriously considering leaving this setup this way. <3 music.
