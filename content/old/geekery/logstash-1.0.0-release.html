Ready for log and event management that doesn't suck or drain your budget? It's
time to logstash.

<p>
After lots of refactoring and improvements to logstash since the first minor
release last November, logstash is ready for wider usage now.

<p>
Read <a
href="https://groups.google.com/group/logstash-users/browse_thread/thread/5a274d530a53eaaa">my announcement here</a>. 

<p>

The logstash site is also online and has docs, intros, slides, and videos.

Happy logstashing!
