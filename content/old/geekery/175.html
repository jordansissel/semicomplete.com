Having found myself with a lack of energy for working on my current projects, I
decided to start a new one. This one aims to be a flexible input-device
framework for FreeBSD.
<p/>

I know next to nothing about the kernel and it's implementation, but
fiddling around so far I've done somewhat well-ish. The first thing I'm
going to do is make a new psm driver that can be loaded as a kernel
module instead of having to be built into the kernel. My first target is
going to be a driver that supports generic PS/2 mouse devices. 

<p/>
Once that's working, I'm hoping I'll be well versed enough in kernel
development to actually start working on a framework for input devices
(keyboards, joysticks, and mice). I'd prefer that things like special
mouse drivers for things like Synaptics touchpads are off in their own
little sub drivers. I also want sysctl tunables for options that are
reasonable to have changed.

<p/>
Right now, I'm not sure how I'm going to implement this framework,
becuase I simply don't know enough about the kernel to know how to do it
properly. More on this as things develop. This should be a fun project
for me seeing as how I've never really dealt with hardware before, nor
have I ever written anything on the kernel level.
