I was trying to install something from ports tonight, and package fetching kept
hanging for a long time. Turns out, for whatever reason, it was trying to
connect to some of the servers on ipv6, which would fail and it would then try
ipv4. This is probably due to some change I made recently but forgot about.

<p>

At any rate, I needed a quick way to kill ipv6 activity on the machine. Trying
'/etc/rc.d/network_ipv6 onestop' didn't seem to have the desired effect, so I
added this rule to my pf.conf:

<pre>
block return out inet6 all
</pre>

Everything is happy now. Probably not the most optimal solution, but I'm not
looking for the optimal solution right now.
