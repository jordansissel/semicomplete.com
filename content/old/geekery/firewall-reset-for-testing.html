Ever configured a firewall remotely? Ever blocked yourself and had to get physical hands to fix it?

<p>

Kind of sucks.

<p>

So you're going to start playing with some new firewall rules, but you learned
from the past and now you have a cron(8) or at(8) job that will reset the
firewall rules to permissive every so often, just in case you lock yourself out.

<p>

I used to do that. Until I realized today that I'm frankly too lazy to wait the
N minutes I'll have to wait for my at(8) job to kick in.

<p>

Now I sniff packets and have a script trigger from that.

<p>

On the remote server, I'll use ngrep to watch for a specific payload in an icmp
echo packet. This works because bpf(4) gets packets before the firewall has a
chance to filter them, meaning even if you deny all packets, bpf(4) (libpcap,
tcpdump, ngrep, etc) will still see those packets.  Here's the script I use on
the remote server:

<p>

<pre>
# Look for any icmp echo packets containing the string 'reset-iptables'
ngrep -l -Wnone -d any 'reset-iptables' 'icmp and icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echo' \
| grep --line-buffered '^I ' \
| while read line ; do 
  iptables -F
  iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
  iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
  iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
done
</pre>

<p>

The ngrep line will output this whenever it sees a matching packet:
<pre>
remotehost% ngrep -l -Wnone -d any 'reset-iptables' 'icmp and icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echo'
interface: any
filter: (ip) and ( icmp and icmp[icmptype] = icmp-echo )
match: reset-iptables
##
I XX.XX.XX.XX -> XX.XX.XX.XX 8:0
....reset-iptablesipta
</pre>

We'll grep for just the 'I' line, then trigger a full firewall reset.

<p>

I couldn't figure out how to use ping(8) and set a specific payload, so I'll
use scapy.

<pre>
workstation% echo 'sr1(IP(dst="remotehost.example.com")/ICMP(type="echo-request")/"reset-iptables")' | sudo scapy
</pre>

Now, if I accidentally lock myself out through firewall rule changes, I can
trivially reset them using that 'echo | scapy' onliner.

<p>

Obviously, I don't keep the reset script running after the firewall rules are
tested and known-good, but it's a great instant-gratification means to solving
the locked-out problem you may face when testing new firewall rules.
