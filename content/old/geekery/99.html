I got bored and thought this atleast marginally useful:<p>

<pre>
my @foo = qw(just another perl monkey);
my $x = 0;
print join("\n",map { $x++ . ": $_" } @foo);
</pre>
<br>
The output is:<p>

<pre>
0: just
1: another
2: perl
3: monkey
</pre>

If you don't know how to use map() then learn, it makes doing large operations on hashes or arrays brutally simple.
