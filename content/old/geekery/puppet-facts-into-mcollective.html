There's a plugin for mcollective that lets you use puppet as your mcollective
fact source. However, it doesn't seem to support the plugins-in-modules
approach that puppet allows, and I don't want to have to regenerate and restart
mcollective any time I add new fact modules.

<p>

Mcollective comes with a yaml fact plugin by default which will load facts from
a yaml file of your choice. Exporting puppet facts in yaml format is super trivial
during a puppet run:

<pre>
  package {
    "mcollective": ensure => "0.4.10-1";
    ...
  }

  file {
    "/etc/mcollective/facts.yaml":
      ensure => file,
      content => inline_template("&lt;%= scope.to_hash.reject { |k,v| !( k.is_a?(String) &amp;&amp; v.is_a?(String) ) }.to_yaml %&gt;"),
      require => Package["mcollective"];
  }
</pre>

Easy. Now each puppet run updates will dump it's fact/parameter knowledge to
that file and mcollective can use those facts:

<pre>
% mc-facts lsbdistrelease
Report for fact: lsbdistrelease                            

        10.04                                   found 18 times

Finished processing 18 hosts in 5533.86 ms
</pre>

An added benefit of this is that any puppet variables (not just facts!) that
are in scope are included in the yaml output. This lets you write "facts" to feed
mcollective and puppet from plain puppet manifests. Awesome!

<p>

<b>Update: </b> Looks like there's a bug/feature somewhere that causes puppet
to output yaml that mcollective can't handle due to sorting problems (like
'!ruby/sym _timestamp'). To solve this, filter the scope hash for keys and
values that are not strings.  I have updated the code above to reflect this.
Future mcollective releases will handle funky data more safely.
