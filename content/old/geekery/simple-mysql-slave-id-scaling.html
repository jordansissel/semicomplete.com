For a current project, I need the ability to dynamically grow and shrink a pool
of mysql slaves. In order for replication to work properly, every slave must
have a unique server id. When you want to grow another slave, how do you choose
the server id?

<p>

Two slaves with the same server id will replicate successfully, but when they
reach the end of the master's binary log, something freaks out and forces them
to disconnect. This causes both slaves to reconnect, sync (no data needed), and
have the connection die off quickly again. The result of this is rapid
connection/disconnection by both slaves driving the load to 1+ on both slaves,
and to around .3 on the master even in a completely idle system. This is bad.
Therefore, server id collisions are bad.

<p>

A simple approach might be to pick a random number. However, depending on your range, collisions may still occur. If there's even a slight chance of collision, you have to detect that collision and try a new number. Collision detection is expensive  and can be done one of a few ways:

<ul>
  <li> query all slaves asking "show global variable like 'server-id'" and
  comparing it against the chosen one. This has O(n) runtime, and doesn't scale.  </li>
  <li> Set the server id to whatever you picked at random, have a heuristic tool that can detect the behavior that happens when two server ids collide. This is obviously a horrible idea. </li>
</ul>

Random choice doesn't seem to be very good. Scanning all slaves and picking an
id that isn't in the set of known ids is also bad, as mentioned above. So what now?

<p>

We need a number that will never repeat. You might think about using a small
table in the master with an auto_increment column and always get a new id that
way, but why? Time is always increasing. Bonus that mysql's server-id is an
unsigned 32bit value, so unix epoch values will be fine until the distant
future.

<p>
A trivial script can generate your my.cnf whenever you bring up a new
slave with the current time as a server id and you're pretty much guaranteed
never to have a collision unless you grow two slaves up at the same second (how
likely is that?).

<p>

Simple mysql config:
<pre>
# my.cnf.in
server-id=SERVERID
</pre>


Simple script to generate a config with a proper serverid:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

m4 -DSERVERID=`date +%s` my.cnf.in > /etc/my.cnf
</pre>

Make this part of your "add a new mysql slave" setup and you'll a scalable
server-id selection system.

<p>

Alternatively, since mysql server-id values are, again, 32 bit, you can simply
use the IP address of the machine itself. Something like this:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Turn an IP into an integer for use with mysql server IDs (or whatever)

$exp = 3;
map { $x += $_ * (2 ** (8 * $exp--)) } split(/\./, $ARGV[1]);
print $x
</pre>

I named it ip2int.pl. You can use Socket's inet_aton and unpack to achieve the
same result here.
<pre>
./ip2int.pl 129.21.60.5
2165652485
</pre>

Since IPs are in theory unique, you can use use the IP of the mysql server for
its own server ID.
