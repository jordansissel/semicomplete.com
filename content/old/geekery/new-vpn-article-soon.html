I keep an eye on my apache access logs to see what kind of traffic my site gets
and why it gets here. It seems that a non-trivial number of searches are for
'vpn over ssh' and similar variants. These land at the 
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/articles/ppp-over-ssh/">ppp over ssh
article</a>. 

<p>

New versions of openssh have built-in support for tunneling, and do not require
ppp at all. Seeing as how I've never really used this new feature, and there's
a nontrivial number of searches ending up on the ppp-over-ssh article, I think
it's time to write a little article on how to use the new openssh built-in
tunneling.

<p>

Stay tuned...
