Did a bit of coding this weekend. PiMP got some pretty major feature upgrades including stream support (think shoutcast). I still need to work on the server<->player protocol aswell as the client<->server protocol. I've got a list of hot features I'm going to add to it as soon as I get more time including iTunes shares support, non-mp3 multimedia support, a graphical frontend, a curses frontend, etc.<p>

I also made some neat changes to topkeys.sh. Topkeys.sh is a handy script I wrote so I could control XMMS with my media/internet buttons on my microsoft keyboard. I no longer use this keyboard and instead use the number pad (which is generally useless to me normally). With this update I added support for multiple interfaces. The two I have written so far are for xmms and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/bottlerocket/">bottlerocket</a>. You can toggle between the two (and a dynamic list of others that I may write.
<br>
If you want to give it a shot, you'll need atleast topkeys.sh and xmms.cf, over there on the right. xmms.cf and other moduley things should go in <code>~/.topkeys/</code><br>
xmms.cf requires xmms, obviously.<br>
x10.cf requires bottlerocket to be installed, get it from freshmeat.


<p>
I also wrote a new perl module this weekend called <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~psionic/http-handle-0.1/">HTTP::Handle</a>. I needed this to make connecting to shoutcast and other mp3 streams less painful, I think it's a good start. I'll update it with some new features sometime soon.
