While Shmoocon doesn't start until Friday, I'm flying out tonight. I haven't
been to DC in 10 years, so I'll probably tourist it up atleast for a few hours.
This week is taking me far away from any work-related activities. I turned off
my pager a few minutes ago, so my vacation has officially begun.

<p>

See you in DC.
