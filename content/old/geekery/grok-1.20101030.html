Changes since last announced release:

<pre>
1.20101030.*
  - Add 'make package-debian' to produce a .deb build of grok.

1.20101018.*
  - API docs via doxygen
  - rdoc for the Ruby module
  - Add Grok::Pile to Ruby

1.20100419.*
  - Fix tests
  - Add a ruby example for pattern discovery
  - Add grok-web example (runs grok in ruby via sinatra to show pattern discovery)
  - Add more time formats (US, EU, ISO8601)
  - Fix bug that prevented multiple patterns with the same complexity from being
    used in discovery.

1.20100416.*
  - Add pattern discovery through grok_discover (C) and Grok#discover (Ruby)
    Idea for this feature documented here:
    http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/grok-pattern-autodiscovery.html
  - The ruby gem is now called 'jls-grok' since someone already had the 'grok'
    gem name on gemcutter.
  - Fix some pattern errors found in the test suite.
  - New version numbering to match my other tools.
</pre>
