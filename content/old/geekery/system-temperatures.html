It occured to me tonight that I didn't have a good way to query temperatures
from a Windows box. I'd used GUI tools to do it before, but that doesn't really
lend itself to automation and monitoring.

<p>

The default SNMP configuration in XP doesn't export temperature (at least
nothing I saw). I knew SMART had temperature information, but that wasn't CPU
temperature or anything else outside the harddrive.

<p>

SMART data is accessible through a number of tools. I've used <a
href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/">smartmontools</a> before, but
didn't know they had a build available for Windows until just now. Same tools
as the Linux/FreeBSD/whatever versions. The device naming is the same as on the
non-windows versions, and the smartctl manpage details the syntax. I wanted
temperature information, and powershell helps make this pretty easy:

<pre>
PS > .\smartctl.exe -a /dev/hda `
     | where {$_ -match "Temperature"} `
     | foreach { $_.split()[-1] }
46
</pre>

<p>

After a bit of randomly permuting search queries, I found that some temperature
information is available through WMI. The temperature values are in tenths of
kelvin. We can query this from powershell:

<pre>
PS > get-wmiobject MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature -namespace "root/wmi" `
     | select CurrentTemperature,InstanceName

CurrentTemperature InstanceName
------------------ ------------
              3102 ACPI\ThermalZone\THRM_0
</pre>

I found this particular WMI class by doing the following after getting some hints from search results:

<pre>
PS > get-wmiobject -namespace "root/wmi" -list | findstr Temp
MSAcpi                                    MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature
</pre>
