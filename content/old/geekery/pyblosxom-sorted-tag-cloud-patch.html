<a href="http://www.atarininja.org/">wxs</a> has this neat tag cloud thing on
his site. I like it so much, I wanted it here on this site, so I installed
plugin last night and put it in place of the 'categories' section of the
sidebar.

<p>

However, the default tag cloud isn't sorted, so finding things in it is, well, hard.

<a href="/misc/tag_cloud-sorted-cloud.patch">Here is a patch</a> that will sort
your tag cloud alphabetically.
