After using HTTP::Handle heavily in my new link spider for work, I found a bunch of bugs and pitfalls that would snag it and make it eat iself. The lacking-features and bugs I found were added and fixed, respectively.
<p>
* <code>$http->connect()</code> now returns -1 on failure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connections will fail on 3 occaisions: <code>socket()</code> fails, <code>connect()</code> fails, or the dns lookup on the hostname fails.<br>
* After the socket is connected, <code>$http->connect()</code> can fail if no data is recevied in a given timeout period, which can be set. See perldoc HTTP::Handle.
<p>

It should be up on CPAN sometime later this morning, I just uploaded it.
