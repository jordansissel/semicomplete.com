Flew out to Rochester for the weekend to hang out with friends and partake in
another BarCamp.

<p>

This barcamp was pretty different, in content, than previous ones. I'm
reasonably certain it had a lot to do with the location: RIT. Being that the
participants were mostly students and professors, the discussion content was
much less web2.0-focused, which was immediately refreshing. Various topics
ranged from ruby, to scapy, to amazon's web services.

<p>

This was my 5th barcamp. In every camp so far, I've lead talks on specific
subjects: ssh tunneling, vim, etc. Focusing on one topic has never been a
feature of my style, and I realized that this morning during the early
sessions. At any given conference, I inevitably become involved in
conversations which touch a project I've done, and I'm generally going to say
"Hey, I have a tool that does that!" a few times.

<p>

So that's what I did my talk on today. I was planning on talking about grok for
the entire session, but instead I talked about a pile of random projects I'd
done in the past year or so. I picked a pretty wide set of projects hoping to
keep people interested. Ones I covered were:
<a href="/projects/keynav">keynav</a>,
<a href="/projects/liboverride">liboverride</a>,
<a href="/projects/grok">grok</a>,
<a href="/blog/geekery/sms-traffic-reports.html">sms traffic reports</a>
<a href="/projects/pam_captcha">pam_captcha</a>,
<a href="/projects/xboxproxy">xboxproxy</a>,
<a href="/projects/xdotool">xdotool</a>,
<a href="/projects/firefox-tabsearch">firefox tabsearch</a>,
<a href="/projects/firefox-urledit">firefox url editor</a>,
and
<a href="/blog/geekery/bypassing-captive-portals.html">captive portal bypass</a>.

<p>

I probably could've talked about a few other projects, but I think limiting it
to about 10 was a good choice.

<p>

I gave a brief demo of all of the projects I could. I ended my talk with some
comments about RIT's rollout of WPA, and pointing out that WPA in a wifi
network as large (by users) as RIT's you aren't protecting yourself from
anything: man-in-the-middle arp poisoning still works. I'm certain there are
fixes that you can implement on the access points, but I doubt those fixes are
enabled.

<p>

I went to a few talks, but forgot my notebook so I don't have notes. Oops. The
night closed with a bunch of us rotating on Rock Band.
