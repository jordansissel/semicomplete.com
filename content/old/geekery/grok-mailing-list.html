For a few days now I've felt that grok should have some kind of mailing list.
Why? It's maturing and now is the time to start building a community.

<p>

What hosting provider should I use?  Sourceforge, berlios, and other open
source hosting sites may provide mailing lists, but they also provide things I
don't need: CVS repository, web hosting, etc. All I needed was mailing lists.

<p>

I had forgotten about Google Groups! I created a new list for grok, <a
href="mailto:grok-users@googlegroups.com">grok-users@googlegroups.com</a>.
There are lots of administrative options available to me as an admin, and the
interface to those options doesn't suck.

<p>

Free and easy mailing list hosting? I'll take it.

<p>

Please join me the on the grok-users mailing list :)
