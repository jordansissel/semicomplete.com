      <description>Preface This article will cover how to setup dns with dynamic updates aswell as configuring your dhcp server to push updates to it aswell.
I assume you already know how to setup plain old dns aswell as plain old dhcp. This is not an introduction to either of those. I used BIND 9 and ISC DHCPD v3 for this article.
If there&amp;rsquo;s anything this article doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover with respect to what you are looking for, leave a comment and I&amp;rsquo;ll do what I can.</description>
