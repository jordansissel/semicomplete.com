      <description>[ This post is a work in progress as I work towards solutions ]
I received an email from Flickr on May 9.
 Subject: Your Flickr account is in violation of our free account limits.
You have more than 50 non-public photos on your free account.
 They gave me 8 days to resolve it &amp;ndash; with the threat of deleting photos. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve used Flickr, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose the content I had uploaded.</description>
