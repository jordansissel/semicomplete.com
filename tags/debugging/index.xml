      <description>At work, we&amp;rsquo;re testing some new real-time bidding on ADX and are working through some performance issues.
Our server is jetty + our code, and we&amp;rsquo;re seeing performance problems at relatively low QPS.
The first profiling attempt used YJP, but when it was attached to our server, the system load went up quickly and looked like this:
load average: 2671.04, 1653.95, 771.93
Not good; the load average while running with the profiler attached jumps to a number roughly equal to the number of application threads (3000 jetty threads).</description>
