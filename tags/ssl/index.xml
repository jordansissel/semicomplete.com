      <description>At work today, I started investigating the latency differences for similar requests between HTTP and HTTPS. Historically, I was running with the assumption that higher latency on HTTPS (SSL) traffic was to be expected since SSL handshakes are more CPU intensive. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about the network consequences of SSL until today.
It&amp;rsquo;s all in the handshake.
TCP handshake is a 3-packet event. The client sends 2 packets, the server sends 1.</description>
