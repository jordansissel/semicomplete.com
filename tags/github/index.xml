      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;time-for-release&#34;&gt;Time for release!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting time. Or, it should be. I want to do a release of fpm! However, there&amp;rsquo;s some preparation I need to do before I can publish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I need to make sure the changelog file is updated and accurate, and that means I need to know all of the changes made since the previous release. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the code changes, though. I mean what behaviors were changed? Who contributed to the change? Is a given change related to one or more open issues?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
