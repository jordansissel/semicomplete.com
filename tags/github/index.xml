      <description>Time for release! It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting time. Or, it should be. I want to do a release of fpm! However, there&amp;rsquo;s some preparation I need to do before I can publish.
I need to make sure the changelog file is updated and accurate, and that means I need to know all of the changes made since the previous release. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the code changes, though. I mean what behaviors were changed?</description>
