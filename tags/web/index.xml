      <description>At work today, I started investigating the latency differences for similar requests between HTTP and HTTPS. Historically, I was running with the assumption that higher latency on HTTPS (SSL) traffic was to be expected since SSL handshakes are more CPU intensive. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about the network consequences of SSL until today.
It&amp;rsquo;s all in the handshake.
TCP handshake is a 3-packet event. The client sends 2 packets, the server sends 1.</description>

      <description>Resig has a bunch of unit tests he does to make sure jQuery works properly on whatever browser. Manually running and checking unit test results is annoying and time consuming. Let&amp;rsquo;s automate this.
Update (May 2010): See this post for more details on automating xserver startup without having to worry about display numbers (:1, :2, etc).
Combine something simple like Firefox and Xvfb (X Virtual Frame Buffer), and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a simple way to run Firefox without a visible display.</description>
